            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Was once reſolved to have ſaid nothing before this Diſcourſe, becauſe I look on Prefaces generally as more faſhionable then neceſsary, and more fit to uſher in ſomething that is pleaſant, then any thing that is ſerious: But conſidering with my ſelf both the Time and Occaſion of my Writing, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomething to have fallen from my Pen ſuitable to both, I then ſaw I was obliged for thy ſake to do that which I hoped I happily might have awarded.</p>
            <p>The Occaſion that put me on Writing was a deſire to ſatisfie my ſelf concerning the truth of the
<pb facs="tcp:58269:3"/>Miracles done by our Saviour: Not that I had in the leaſt any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of them; but becauſe I found Atheiſm, through the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of our Times, was grown ſo impudent, that in most places where I came the only Wit was to queſtion Principles, and no man was Ingenious but he that talked most confidently againſt the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of our Faith. I was amazed when once I heard the Miracles done by our Saviour que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned, and that not only for Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument ſake, but with much zeal and earnestneſs; becauſe the Evangeliſts who relate them were Parties, and therefore upon no Reaſon ought to be admitted as Witneſſes. This Argument ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to carry in it great plauſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and I perceived ſeveral, who wanted not Abilities, very much
<pb facs="tcp:58269:3"/>taken with it, as if all our Faith was to fall before it, when this proceeded meerly from want of ſearching to the bottom; for I can believe no man that is Rational, but muſt in this particular receive ſufficient ſatisfaction, if he will but take half that pains to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme himſelf in the Truth, which divers amongst us have done to ſhake it.</p>
            <p>This was the principal aim of this Diſcourſe; and I hope I have in this Particular produced the Confeſſions of Jews and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, the open Enemies of our Faith, which may perſwade any perſon, ſince they were not Parties, <hi>(their own Argument)</hi> to believe the truth of them. I confeſs, we do in this Age want many Records the Primitive Chriſtians Appealed to for the Truth of what they ſaid.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:58269:4"/>
            <p> As the <hi>Archives</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> which <hi>Tertullian</hi> produceth to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Senate,<note place="margin">Apol. cap. <hi>21.</hi>
               </note> as a witneſs of the miraculous Eclipſe at our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Crucifixion; The Acts of <hi>Pilate,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Apol.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 66.</note> which <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires the Emperour <hi>Antoninus</hi> to ſearch, concerning the Miracles done by our Saviour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But, thanks be to God, we are not yet deſtitute, but we have ſome Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities remaining, not to be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted. And for my part, I cannot but judg that ſufficient, had we no more, The ſtrange Conqueſt of the World to the Croſs of Chriſt, ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by ſuch weak and ignorant perſons as the Apoſtles were; when the Doctrine they taught did not only deprive the embracers of it, of all the Pomp, and Pleaſure, and Glory of this world, but ſubjected them to all the miſeries and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb facs="tcp:58269:4"/>the cruelty of the Devil or man could invent.</p>
            <p>To theſe I have added the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities of the moſt Eminent Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Primitive Church, for the moſt part taken out of either their Apologies to the Emperours and Senate, for their Faith, or their Anſwers to the Diſcourſes of the Heathen Philoſophers againſt it. And for my part I cannot but perſwade my ſelf, that no ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional man but will believe, that ſuch Learned men as they were (for I ſpeak not now of them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any other Notion) durſt plead to the Senate and Emperours, as Arguments to take off their Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, the Miracles they then did, unleſs the matter of Fact they urged had been true and not fictitious: For certainly, had it been otherwiſe, inſtead of mitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating,
<pb facs="tcp:58269:5"/>they had but enraged their Enemies; inſtead of leſſening their puniſhments, they had encreaſed them.</p>
            <p>Againſt this of Miracles, I meet but with one Argument our Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts have invented, (which they may thank the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for, who by their fooliſh Legends, and Monkiſh doteries have beguil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very many into the belief of their apparent erours, and that is, That they believe the Real Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles done by Chriſt, and Chriſtians for ſome Ages after our Saviours Paſſion; were Deceits and Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures. And though this be very preſumptuous, to ſuppoſe all the world could be cheated ſo much, contrary to their Intereſt, becauſe they ſee ſome now beguiled and abuſed by thoſe whoſe Intereſt 'tis to do ſo: Yet I think to this there
<pb facs="tcp:58269:5"/>is an Anſwer beyond a Reply; for though it be very eaſie for men to feign Miracles, when the Patient conſpires in the deceit as well as the Agent; yet it is impoſſible to deceive, when he that is miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly recovered, doth oppoſe both the Doctrins and Perſons of them that do it. Here now we produce you Miracles done upon Heathens themſelves, who were ſo far from conſpiring to deceive the world into the Chriſtian Faith, that they made it their buſineſs to deſtroy the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of it. Here we produce the gods they worſhipped, confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing themſelves Devils, trembling at the Name of Jeſus, and not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to lye to the meaneſt Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>Neither is it at all material to ſay, as I have heard ſome do, That the Devils might confeſs, to deceive the world after another
<pb facs="tcp:58269:6"/>manner. 'Tis poſſible they might do ſo, (that being their proper work) but here this diceit is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy himſelf, his Kingdom, the Dominion he gained over the whole world, to fix into the hearts of people Principles againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and to uphold a generation of men that reſist him, renounce him, and fight againſt him.</p>
            <p>To this let me add, That theſe Miracles were done without any outward Applications, without any Spells or Charms, without the leaſt matter to work on, but only by the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, and that not by ſome Eminent Christians, but by any Christian, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Arnobius</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently aſſures me.<note place="margin">Apol. ca. 21. Adv. Gen. l. 1</note>
            </p>
            <p>If it be asked me now, Whether the Power of Miracles ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues in the Church? I muſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<pb facs="tcp:58269:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>with <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Auſtin,</hi> That he that wants a Miracle to believe, is now a Prodigie himſelf, that doth not believe when the world believeth: But yet this I find, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> was very much grieved at <hi>Epaphro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditus</hi> his ſickneſs,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.</note> and did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover him, when he did daily others; and I ſuppoſe upon this ground, becauſe God beſtowed this miraculous power to convert to Chriſtianity, which was not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> already a Chriſtian; and 'tis not improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble but God might still bleſs his Church with thoſe extraordinary gifts for the converſion of Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, which are not to be expected of us, who are Chriſtians already.</p>
            <p>If now this be true, which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly no man can queſtion, who will believe any thing he hath not ſeen? If our Saviours Miſſion
<pb facs="tcp:58269:7"/>and Doctrine, if the Chriſtianity the Apoſtles received from him, and the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church from them, be confirmed by Miracles, 'tis not only irrational, but perfect folly, to queſtion any truth our Bleſſed Saviour hath delivered, be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much above the reach of our frail <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Reaſonings, ſince God for the truth of it hath annexed his Seal to it: For he that ſhall doe ſo, muſt either believe there is no God, which is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory to the very nature of a Miracle, or which is worſe, that God confirms that which is not true.</p>
            <p>I have nothing further to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form thee of, but the time of my writing, which thou maist eaſily perceive, in reading, without my telling it. 'Twas ſome years ago,
<pb facs="tcp:58269:7"/>in the midſt of thoſe miſeries we groaned under; and then it was no wonder Atheiſm took ſo deep root amongst us, when an outward form of Godlineſs was made a Cloak for all manner of impieties and villanies.</p>
            <p>It was much to be hoped, ſince God hath worked a Wonderful thing, if not a Miracle, amongst us, ſince God hath reſtored our King and Church, beyond all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, without the least drop of blood, that this it ſelf ſhould have rooted out thoſe Poſitions which our late wicked Times had bred amongst us; but ſince 'tis other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, I hope I may be pardoned for giving the World this trouble. I am too ſenſible of mine own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections to expect much from ſo ſleight a Piece; but having had the happineſs by it to ſatisfie ſome
<pb facs="tcp:58269:8"/>whilſt it was in MSS, I hope it may more now it is publiſhed; and if it doth but engage ſome Learned Perſon to write in our Engliſh Language of this Subject, I ſhall judg my pains well ſpent, becauſe I am confident nothing will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce more to the Glory of God, and good of his Church, which I aſſure thee was, and ever ſhall be the aim of the Author.</p>

            <head>The Truth and Reaſonableneſs of the Religion delivered by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</head>
            <p>I Hope no man will judge an Apology for Chriſtianity either impertinent or unſeaſonable in this Age, when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the greater ſort of men the Name only remains, and the Practice is vaniſhed. Theſe Apoſtatizing times have bereft us of many great advantages the Primitive Chriſtians had for the increaſing of their Belief. And 'tis ſad to conſider, that the Foundations of our Faith have been ſo totter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſhaken, by the moſt horrid actions of pretended Chriſtians, that too too many have been apt to believe Religion to be nothing elſe but Policy, and a crafty Art to perſwade mens Conſciences to act that for God, which otherways their very reaſon would inform them to be moſt horrid. Chriſtianity is not to be blamed upon this account, whoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples are not only pure, but peaceable. A Religion never propagated but by ſufferings; the Martyrs flames enlightned the world into a belief of Chriſt, not their hands. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour did not only bring peace into the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58269:10"/>world at his birth, but left it as the beſt Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy he could give his Diſciples, when he went to his Father. The Primitive Fathers through all their Perſecutions counted Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Tears the only Arms lawful for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his moſt excellent Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy tells the Romanes how deſolate their Countrey would be, if the Chriſtians would but forſake them, that they would preſently be a prey to their Enemies.</p>
            <p>Without doubt (ſaith he) you would be amazed at your ſolitarineſs,<note place="margin">Procul dubio expaviſſetis ad ſolitudinem veſtram, ad ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium rerum, &amp; ſtuporem quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam quafi mortui Orbis: Quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſiſſetis quibus imperaretis, plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res hostes quàm Cives vobis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſſiſſent, nunc cum paucio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res hoſtes habetis prae multitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine Chriſtianorum. <hi>Ap. ca<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 37.</hi>
               </note> at the ſilence of things, at ſuch a ſtupor as if the World was dead: You would ſeek who to command; more Enemies would remain then Citizens; for now you have fewer Enemies by reaſon of the multitude of Chriſtians. You ſee the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians were then ſenſible both of their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and of their power: Yet how boldly doth this excellent Father challenge them to accuſe the Chriſtians of any Conſpiracy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Magiſtrates, of the leaſt wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as firing their Enemies Towns, or of any revenge when the greateſt lay in their power. Nay he concludes this with an <hi>Abſit.</hi> God forbid this Divine Sect ſhould be revenged by humane fire,<note place="margin">Sed abſit aut igni humano vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicetur divina Secta, aut dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at pati in quo probatur.</note> or ſhould grieve to ſuffer in what it is tryed.</p>
            <p>This I have begun with as a Preface to my
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58269:10"/>Diſcourſe, that the World might ſee 'tis not Chriſtianity, 'tis not Religion doth counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ſuch actions; but that the Devil (who when he pleaſeth can transform himſelf into an Angel of light) doth endeavour to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Atheiſme, by infatuating his Vaſſals to abuſe Religion, to uſe that as a Cloak; and ſo he hopes when the vizard is off, and theſe Hypocrites appear in their colours, the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion they profeſs will vaniſh with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors.</p>
            <p>This being premiſed, I hope I need not juſtifie my ſelf in endeavouring to maintain ſo great a Truth, which I think in no time needs more to be ſtudied then now, when the open Adverſaries of Chriſtianity do not only encreaſe in their number, but in their confidence; and the iniquity of our times permits men not only to maintain in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, what formerly they durſt ſcarce think, but alſo publickly to vent Atheiſtical Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in Print, as no Chriſtian ear can ſuffer.</p>
            <p>Chriſtianity is a Doctrine will no way pleaſe our Atheiſts, who are ſo far from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying themſelves, that they only count them wiſe men, whoſe buſineſs is to pleaſe, and enjoy themſelves. 'Tis no wonder theſe men are loth to believe a God, when they wiſh there were none. 'Tis an excellent ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Minutius Felix,</hi> which I have often thought on.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:58269:11"/>
            <p> I am not ignorant (ſaith he that there are many who out of the conſcientiouſneſs of their deſerts,<note place="margin">Nec ignoro pleroſque ex con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientia meritorum ſe poſt mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem nihil eſſe magis optare quàm credere; Mallent enim pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitùs extingui quàm ad Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia reparari.</note> do rather wiſh then believe they ſhall be nothing after their death; for they had rather be extinguiſhed then be repaired to Judgment.</p>
            <p>To theſe men I ſhall only ſay what <hi>Arnobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> hath put in my mouth almoſt upon the like occaſion.<note place="margin">Sed &amp; ipſe quae pollicetur non probat. Ita eſt: Nulla enim, ut dixi, futurorum poteſt eſſe comprobatio. Cùm ergo haec ſit conditio futurorum, ut teneri &amp; comprehendi nullius poſſunt Anticipationis attactu; Nonne purior ratio eſt ex duobus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certis, &amp; in ambigua expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione pendentibus, id potius credere quod aliquas ſpes ferat quàm omnino quod nullas: In illo enim periculi nihil eſt ſi quod dicitur imminere caſſum fiat &amp; vacuum, in hoc dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num eſt maximum, id eſt ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis amiſſio, ſi cum tempus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venerit apperiatur non fuiſſe mendacium. <hi>Arnob. lib. 2. p. 44.</hi>
               </note> But Chriſt (ſay the Heathens) doth not prove there ſhall be that future exiſtence which he promiſeth. Be it ſo: For (as I have ſaid) there can be no proof of future things. When therefore this is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of all future things that they cannot be reached or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended with any reach of Anticipation; Is not that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon beſt of two uncertainties that depend upon ambiguous expectation, to believe that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which carries ſome hope in it, then that at all which carries none. For in this there is no danger, if that which is ſaid to hang over us be empty and vain, but in that there is the greateſt damage, that is the loſs of Salvation, if when the time comes that be found no lye.</p>
            <p>I ſhall principally direct my Diſcourſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58269:11"/>this ſort of men, who I cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly call Atheiſts, becauſe they acknowledge a God, but yet tell us he regards not theſe petty inconſiderable actions of men; as the Poet ſpeaks of <hi>Jupiter;</hi> That he is not at leiſure to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at theſe trifling affairs.<note place="margin">Non vacat exiguis rebus adeſſe Jovi. <hi>Ovid.</hi>
               </note> And truly it would be well for men of theſe Principles, that their poſition was true; for then they might hope that God in another world would not take account of thoſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which he conſiders not here. Againſt theſe men I ſay I will direct my Diſcourſe; and the beſt way (in mine opinion) to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them of the truth of Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is to preſs thoſe Arguments againſt them which were the firſt Motives to move the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man world to believe a Crucified Saviour. For if the Romanes were rational, wiſe, and underſtanding men, and neither in parts nor underſtanding at all inferiour to the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent amongſt us, the ſame reaſons that had ſtrength enough in them to convince them, muſt have ſtrength enough in them to convince us. Now the firſt Motive that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them to conſider the Doctrine of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, were thoſe extraordinary Miracles that Chriſt, the Apoſtles, and Chriſtians did for a very long time amongſt them, which being obvious to ſenſe, the moſt obſtinate Heathen could not deny; and being above the power of man, the moſt willful amongſt them could not but acknowledge to be done
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58269:12"/>by the finger of God. This of Miracles is that I ſhall moſt particularly inſiſt upon; but my intentions are, before I come to prove theſe Miracles, to treat of thoſe ſeveral other Arguments which are uſed by Chriſtians to confirm their Faith: And though to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate perſon there is none of them but carries weight enough in them to aſſure him both of the truth and excellency of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity: Yet to the moſt obſtinate Rationa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt (if I may ſo call him) that Argument which carries along with it Omnipotency, that never goes without Gods Seal atteſting it, muſt force him to believe, what perhaps he is moſt loth to do.</p>
            <p>The Method I ſhall follow is this.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, I ſhall ſhew you, that both the Jews and Gentiles expected ſuch a Prince to ariſe out of <hi>Judaea;</hi> and the Jews generally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Chriſts coming.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, That the Jews that now expect him, confeſs the time they expected him to be paſt.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, That there was one <hi>Jeſus</hi> that did come, whom both he and we ſay was that Prince.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, That this <hi>Jeſus</hi> that did come, did come about the time the Jews expected him, and did anſwer all the Propheſies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Meſſias.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, I ſhall prove that the Religion delivered by this <hi>Jeſus,</hi> is, where it is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove reaſon, moſt reaſonable, and upon the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58269:12"/>Principles of Reaſon ought to be admitted; Where it is above the reach of Reaſon, and depends upon the Authority of the Lawgiver, is confirmed by Miracles, which carrying Omnipotency, and Gods Seal perpetually annexed unto them, need not deſire but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand admittance.</p>
            <p>I ſhall begin with the firſt,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Theſis</hi> 1.</note> to ſhew that about that time of our bleſſed Saviours In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, not only the Jews did expect their <hi>Meſſias,</hi> but the Heathens did dread ſome King to be born in <hi>Judaea,</hi> who ſhould rule the World: And though perhaps both of them looked for a Temporal Prince, yet 'tis conſiderable, that though they were mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken in the manner how, yet they were not in the thing, that ſuch a Prince ſhould ariſe in <hi>Judaea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the Jews firſt.</p>
            <p>Had we no other Teſtimonies then that S. <hi>John</hi> gives us of the woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>John</hi> 4.25.</note>
               <hi>I know that when the Meſſias cometh;</hi> we might eaſily ſuppoſe 'twas a thing univerſally belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and known, or elſe it would not by ſuch a perſon have been ſo confidently aſſerted. But in <hi>John</hi> 3. we may find all men muſing whether <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> was not the Chriſt.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>John</hi> 3.15.</note> In <hi>John</hi> 7. we find it taken for granted,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>John</hi> 7.27.</note> that he was to come, becauſe the Jews tell us, that <hi>when he cometh, no man knoweth whence he is;</hi> and more particularly by the Quaere follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>When Chriſt cometh can he do more Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles?</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>verſe</hi> 37.</note> But what need I ſay more of this
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58269:13"/>when it was not only the expectation of the Ancient Jews, but is ſtill of the Modern, who (as credible Authors aſſure us) do at this day upon any tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous weather open their win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows in expectation of him.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Jews in their Liturgy ſing at this day this ſad verſe.</hi> Veniat Elias Propheta, Elias Propheta, Elias Propheta, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentè ad nos veniat cum Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah filio Davidis. <hi>As Hoorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck teacheth us in his</hi> 2. lib. cap. 1. pag. 193. De converten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis &amp; convincendis Judaeis. <hi>In the night of the Feaſt of the Propitattion they pray.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoretur coram te memoria Meſſiae fi ii Davidis ſervi tui, &amp; memoris populi tui. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
               </note> I know ſome of them begin now to be ſo hardned, and are ſo ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in their expectation, that as they excuſe his not coming at the time we ſay he ſhould, becauſe of the ſins of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; ſo are apt to believe he never will come for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p>'Tis an anſwer they have invented, in my opinion, very fatal to themſelves, and to their converſion very prejudicial: For as they have no ground to ſay, that God who promiſed the Meſſias of his free goodneſs, and without Condition, ſhould not ſend him in the fulneſs of time according to his promiſe, be the ſins of the people never ſo great; ſo it is in its own nature impoſſible to overthrow ſuch an anſwer when the matter of the anſwer is true, but the reaſon falſe. 'Tis as impoſſible for us, I ſay, to prove, that can be no reaſon, as it is for them to prove it is a reaſon; and ſo when the Jews give us that reaſon, and only inſtance in ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of Gods deferring his promiſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the ſins of the people, they only prove, that had not Chriſt come, that might
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58269:13"/>have been a reaſon, which at moſt amounts but to a probability; So when we reply to them, we cannot ſay that can be no reaſon Chriſt had not come, becauſe what may be probable cannot be ſaid to be impoſſible; but this we ſay, 'tis no reaſon becauſe Chriſt is come. And ſo you may ſee this willful Nation are come to this paſs, that reſolving not to believe Chriſt come, they will anſwer Gods promiſes, which are as well certain for the time as the thing, with an anſwer which is at moſt but probable; and this probability concurring with their wills ſways more with them then the greateſt certainty. I ſhall ſay no more of this here, becauſe when I come to my ſecond Propoſition I ſhall have a fitter occaſion to handle it.</p>
            <p>I ſhall proceed to ſhew you the ſecond part of this Propoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Gentiles had ſome expectation of ſuch a Prince to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe. And this will appear,</p>
            <p n="1">1. From the authority of the Sybils, who evidently foretold him in all the Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he came; which if they did, we have ſufficient reaſon to believe the Gentiles ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected him, becauſe 'tis evident they eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them true Propheteſſes. That they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved their authority we need no other to aſſure us but the Poet, who commands as great a credit to his word,<note place="margin">Credite me vobis folium reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare Sybillae. <hi>Juven.</hi>

I might cite more Authors to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but I need not; there remains but one thing to ſtrengthen this Argument, which till of late I think for this laſt 1000. years was never queſtioned by Chriſtians, and not now by any but thoſe that either deny or queſtion all Antiquity; and that is, that thoſe Verſes wherein our Saviour is ſo clearly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied was theirs, and not foiſted under their names by ſome Chriſtian in the firſt times of Chriſtianity. This I ſhall prove unto you with as much brevity as I can.</p>
            <p>But before I come to it, it is neceſſary for me to premiſe thus much; That where a matter of Fact is denyed, it is impoſſible to prove it, but by Authority, or by Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which only amount to a probability; for no higher demonſtration is the matter ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of, and ſo great a force our Arguments

               </note> that we had rather call the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byll the Childe of God then Jeſus, when he aſſevers that we have inſerted many and blaſphemous things into the Sibylls books, and ſhews us

All that I can gather from this place is, that <hi>Celſus</hi> being preſſed with the Sibylls authorities, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no way to anſwer them, thought it the ſureſt anſwer to ſay, that the Chriſtians had foiſted thoſe verſes in them; which methinks is no reaſon for us to believe a ſatisfactory anſwer; when <hi>Origen</hi> here in this place, wondering at ſo confident an aſſertion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt of proof.

            <p n="2">2. My ſecond Argument for the Sybills works, which I told you before could amount but to a probability, is this.</p>
            <p>That the books of <hi>Hyſtaſpis,</hi> and the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bills, were by Heathen Laws forbidden to be read; which had they been eſteemed as ſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, it had been much a better way to have made the fraud publick, then to have prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited the reading of their Books. Now that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58269:16"/>ſuch a Law was made, <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> aſſures us in his ſecond Apology to <hi>Antoninius Pius.</hi> Theſe are his words.<note place="margin">

            <p>This we may gather alſo from the Letter the Emperour <hi>Valerianus</hi> wrote to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, as <hi>Flavius Vopianus</hi> teacheth us, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he ſaith; I wonder holy Fathers you doubt ſo long of opening the Sibylline books,<note place="margin">Miror vos patres ſancti tamdiu de aperiendis libris Sybillinis dubitaſſe, perinde quaſi in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianorum Eccleſia, &amp; non in Templo omnium Deorum tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retis. <hi>This place is cited by</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius, <hi>Anna. 1.

               </note> as if you were handling this in a Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſtians, and not in the Temple of all the Gods.</p>
            <p>The Orator <hi>Tully</hi> alſo in his book <hi>de Divinatione</hi> ſeems to mention this Law,<note place="margin">Injuſſu Senatus proditum eſt à Majoribus nè legantur quidem libri. <hi>de Divinat. lib. 2.</hi>
               </note> when he tells us it was delivered by the Antients, that theſe books were not to be read without the Senates leave.</p>
            <p>And ſomething to this purpoſe hath <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſius Halicarnaſsaeus,</hi> whoſe words are theſe: After the expulſion of Kings,<note place="margin">

            <p>From this place I ſuppoſe I may gather the great care the Romans had for their preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which makes it a far more difficult thing to foiſt any thing in them, and an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie thing for an Heathen Emperour to ſee whether the Quotations the Chriſtians uſed out of them were ſpurious or no. And this place ſeems to intimate ſomething of what <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> before told us, when it tells us they were by Law ſo ſtrictly kept, that it was dangerous for their very keepers, without others by Publick Authority delegated with them, to read them. Certainly an Apologiſt durſt write nothing but Truth, when on the truth of their Apology their life and every thing dear unto them depended. And I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs I know not why the Roman Emperours ſhould not forbid the reading of the Sybills Oracles,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ep.</hi> 42.</note> as well as <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate did all the Gentile books by a Law, when the true reaſon why he did this, was to keep the Chriſtians in ignorance of their horrid Rites; (although he pretends that they might not blaſpheme their gods) and by that means to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58269:17"/>hinder their confuting them. I am ſure the advantage the Chriſtians gain by the Sybills would be the greater, becauſe their books would confirm them in their own Religion, when the Gentiles could make them only abhorre their. If you ask me how theſe Propheſies came ſo publick, when they were ſo ſtrictly kept. The anſwer is eaſie; for it appears, that <hi>Attilius</hi> privately writ them out, and for that cauſe was put into a leather bag, and caſt into the Sea; as <hi>Dionyſius Halicar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſaeus</hi> and <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> will inform us,<note place="margin">Dionyſ. lib. <hi>4.</hi> Valer. li. c. <hi>13.</hi>
               </note> if no body elſe beſides him did it. I would not in this place be miſtaken, as if I thought what I have ſaid concerning the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bills were ſufficient to prove, that thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies we have, that go under their name, were all theirs: For though I verily believe much of them were really the Sybills Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies; yet I doubt not but many things have been added, and foiſted in them many years after Chriſt. And 'tis ſufficient for my purpoſe, that there were Propheſies extant, whether they were the Sybills, or no, which foretold ſuch a Prince to ariſe; as appears both from <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Varro,</hi> and many other Authors, ſome whereof lived before Chriſt. But I hope if what I have ſaid be not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, yet the Ingenious Appendix of my Learned Friend will make it more then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that the Propheſies that go under their names, were for the moſt part theirs, and ought to be ſo admitted. And thus much for the Sybills.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:58269:17"/> 2. Our ſecond Argument, that the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens expected ſuch a Prince, ſhall be from the Affirmations of ſeveral of them.</p>
            <p>The firſt ſhall be that great Maſter of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, <hi>Tully,</hi> who in his ſecond book <hi>de Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinatione,</hi> hath this paſſage well worth our noting. What Authority (ſaith he) hath that madneſs,<note place="margin">Quid vero habet Autoritatis furor ille, quem divinum voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, ut quae ſapiens non videat, ea videat Inſanus, &amp; is qui humanos ſenſus amiſerit, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos aſſecutus ſit? Sybillae ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus obſervamus quos illa furent fudiſſe dicitur, quorum Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pres nuper, falſa quadam homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num fama dicturus in Senatis putabatur eum, quem revera Regem habebamus, appellandum quoque eſſe Regem, ſi ſalvi eſſe vellemus. <hi>Pag. 295. Edit. Par.</hi>
               </note> which we call Divine, that a mad man ſhould ſee thoſe things which a wiſe man cannot, and that he who hath loſt humane ſenſes ſhould obtain divine? We obſerve the Sybills verſes which ſhe is ſaid to have utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when ſhe was mad, whoſe Interpreter by ſome falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of men was ſuppoſed to be about to ſpeak them in the Senate, <hi>viz.</hi> That he whom in truth we have had a King, ſhould be called a King, if we would be ſafe. I much admire at theſe men that ſuppoſe the Sybills Oracles were foiſted by Chriſtians, when we here have <hi>Tully</hi> not only mentioning them, but telling us that they foretold a King whom we ought to call ſo, if we would be ſafe. Now how this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curres with the Propheſies we have of them, I need not tell any man that hath read them. And 'tis more conſiderable, that <hi>Cicero</hi> being a very great enemy to Monarchy, doth fancy theſe Verſes were made to advance that new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begun Empire. If I miſtake him not, his
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:58269:18"/>words ſignifie ſo much.<note place="margin">Hoc ſi eſt in libris, in quem Hominum, &amp; in quod tempus eſt? Callidè enim qui illa com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſuit perfecit, ut quodcunque accidiſſet, praedictum videre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur hominum, &amp; temporum de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitione ſublata. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
               </note> If this be in the Sybills Books, unto what man, and unto what time doth it belong? For he that made theſe Verſes acted ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that whatſoever might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen might ſeem to be foretold, the definition both of the perſon and time being taken away. By this we may ſee how theſe poor Sybills are toſſed; <hi>Cicero</hi> fancies that ſome Heathen that favoured Monarchy made them, and <hi>Celſus</hi> ſays the Chriſtians made them. Theſe Affirmations being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory, cannot both be true; the firſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently deſtroys the ſecond; and <hi>Tullies</hi> mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake ariſeth from another miſtake; had he rightly underſtood them, he would ſcarcely have imagined them the fiction of a Heathen. Here is one thing not to be overlooked, that this Oratour tells us.<note place="margin">Ex primis verſuum literis ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid connectitur. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
               </note> That out of the firſt Letters of every verſe ſomething is ſignified; Which how well it agrees with the Verſes of the Sybill of <hi>Erythaea,</hi>

               </note>
               <hi>Varro,</hi> and S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> out of him will inform the enquirer. I have been longer on this Authority then I ſhall be on the reſt, becauſe this advantaged much what before I have affirmed of the Sybills; and if it doth ſo, I am ſure <hi>Tully,</hi> though he miſapplyed it, as it was the fortune of others to do, had then ſome notion of a King to ariſe.</p>

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:58269:19"/>that none born that year ſhould be educated. They who had wives great with Child (as much as every one could from hence draw hope to themſelves) took care leſt that Decree of the Senate ſhould be brought to the Treaſury.

               </note> He that conſiders theſe Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties well muſt evidently ſee Gods providence in theſe predictions, making way for the coming of our Saviour.

To this purpoſe you ſhall finde the greateſt Rabbi of our Age, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſe Ben Iſrael,</hi> telling us from Rabbi <hi>Elianus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vitia &amp; peccata populi in cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa eſſe, cur adventus Meſſiae ulterius longiuſque dies iſte eſſet dilatus, adeo ut treeenti anni ultra quatuor mille anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum elapſi ſunt. <hi>Man. lib. 3. de Reſ.

               </note> That the vices and ſins of the people was the cauſe why the day of the coming of the Meſſias
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:58269:20"/>was deferred further and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, inſomuch that 300 years are already paſſed more then 4000. And <hi>Manaſſe</hi> himſelf having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated R. <hi>Elianus</hi>'s opinion, concurs with it, when he tels us, And truly it is moſt certain,<note place="margin">Et profectò veriſſimum eſt, ſi Iſraelitae ſeriò factorum egiſſent proenitentiam, Meſſiae adventus non fuiſſet procraſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
               </note> if the Iſraelites would moſt ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly repent of their deeds, the coming of the Meſſias had not been delayed.</p>
            <p>This is the Propoſition we have in hand af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed; for nothing can be ſaid to be defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but the time of whoſe coming is paſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe in the publick Prayers now uſed amongſt them they pray as if they were in deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair of his coming. Now it is not rational to ſuppoſe that they ſhould deſpair of a delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, if the time when they expected delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance be not in their own opinion paſt. I have before repeated ſome few paſſages out of their Liturgies: I ſhall add theſe, which <hi>Hoornbeck</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords us in the very place I before mentined.

            <p n="4">4.

I will not enter upon this diſpute; but this being ſimply granted, that he ſhall then come, and the Reſurrection of the dead ſhall then be. And then adding the place of <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.35. he then concludes, that in the ſame day and time the Meſſias ſhall come, and the dead riſe. I confeſs, to me from theſe words no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is clearer but that he is willing to ſhuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle Chriſts firſt coming off quite and cleane, or at leaſt defer it to his ſecond, upon very tri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vial accounts, by which we may eaſily gather they have ſo long talked of ſuch a thing that they are aſhamed to deny it, and yet ſo ſlight it, as if they ſcarcely believed there would be any ſuch thing. Thus I have briefly from the Jews deſpair of his coming, and the reaſons they urge why he is not come, proved from themſelves a tacite confeſſion, that the time ſince they ſuppoſed he ſhould have come is paſt. I proceed to the third, which is,</p>

Now to prove matter of Fact, as I told you, our beſt proofs are Authorities; and that I ſhall do, not from Chriſtians, but from the enemies of Chriſtianity, Heathens; and a confeſſion of an enemy is not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by any that will not deny Principles themſelves.</p>

            <p n="2">2. The ſecond Author that aſſures us there was ſuch a perſon as Chriſt, is <hi>Suetonius,</hi> who in his fifth Book and twenty fifth Chapter tells us, That <hi>Claudius</hi> expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Jews out of <hi>Rome,</hi>

And truly it is no wonder through the Devils inſtigation the Heathens ſhould have that violent hatred to the name, which was it ſelf ſo dreadful to their Idols (as hereafter I ſhall prove) and was the only crime, if their greateſt honour may be once ſo named, they could ever be accuſed of. I have ſaid this concerning the name of <hi>Chreſtianus,</hi> becauſe though <hi>Suetoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> differs in a letter, yet it might appear to be a voluntary and envious miſtake, and ſo his authority may paſs without control.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third ſhall be that of <hi>Pliny</hi> the younger, which doth not ſo directly mention Chriſt as the other Authors do, but telling us of the Chriſtians, affirms the God they ſerved to be Chriſt. It is in his Letter to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Trajan,</hi> which he purpoſely wrote to know what he ſhould do with that ſort of men. And therein he tells the Emperour, That he puniſhed them for their obſtinacy rather then any thing elſe. He tells him alſo, That there were ſome that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed themſelves to be Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,<note place="margin">Pervicaciam certe &amp; inflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilem obſtinationem debere puniri. <hi>lib. 10.

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:58269:25"/>could be compelled. He adds alſo, That there were others which affirmed they had been Chriſtians, but now were not; and ſays, that all theſe worſhip the Emperours Image, and the Gods. Theſe by the way I muſt tell you were the <hi>Gnoſtiques,</hi> whoſe Principles were to deny Chriſt rather to ſuffer for him.</p>
            <p>Now from theſe Haereticks <hi>Pliny</hi> gives the Emperour an account of the Religion of the Chriſtians. They affirm, ſaith he, this to be the ſum either of their fault or errour, that they were wont upon a determined day,<note place="margin">Adfirmabant autem hanc fuiſſe ſummam aut culpae ſuae aut er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roris, quòd eſſent ſoliti ſtato die ante lucem convenire, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menque Chriſto quaſi Deo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere ſecum invicem; ſeque Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramento non in ſcelus aliquid obſtringere, ſed nè furta, nè latrocinia, nè adulteria com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitterent, nè fidem fallerent, nè depoſitum appellati abnega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent: Quibus peractis, morem ſibi diſcedendi fuiſſe rurſuſque coeundi ad capiendum cibum promiſcuum, tamen &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxium.</note> before break of day, to meet together, and to fing turn by turn verſes amongſt themſelves to Chriſt as God; and that they bound themſelves by an Oath, not to any wickedneſs, but that they might not commit Thefts, nor Robberies, nor Adulteries; that they might not break their promiſe, nor deny the pledge when the owner calls for it; which being done, that it was their cuſtom to depart, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to meet to eat together promiſcuouſly, but without any hurt. We ſee here what a notable deſcription, or rather confeſſion of the excellency of the Chriſtian Principles we have from the mouth of a Heathen. 'Tis true, afterwards he calls it <hi>Superſtitionem pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vam &amp; immodicam,</hi> an empty and vain ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:58269:25"/>which is to be wondred at to come from ſo ſober a pen, when the Principles he before repeated, to a natural man ſavors ſo much of ſobriety and reaſon. Perhaps he durſt ſay no otherwiſe; but this he concludeth with. It is evidently certain,<note place="margin">Certè ſatis conſtat prope jam de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolata Templa coepiſſe celebrari, &amp; ſacra ſolennia diu intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa, rep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

From theſe words we may gather how great a conqueſt Chriſtianity in ſo ſhort a time had made, that their Temples ſhould be deſolate, that there ſhould be no buyers of Sacrifices to their Gods, unleſs a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of return and repentance be allowed to Chriſtians, who lapſed upon no other account but fear of torment. Fear made Heathens, and only Reaſon Chriſtians. The Rack was that that filled their Temples, not their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, not the power of their Idol Gods.</p>
            <p>To theſe Heathen Authorities let me add the Jews, who confeſs there was one Jeſus that did come. Their <hi>Talmudiſts</hi> call him <hi>ſuſpenſum,</hi> that is, <hi>hanged;</hi> which they do, ſuppoſing it the moſt opprobrious and curſed
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:58269:26"/>title they could give him, becauſe their Law ſaith, <hi>Curſed be every one that hangeth upon a Tree. Benjaminus Judilenſis</hi> in his Itinerary acknowledgeth him ſlain at <hi>Hieruſalem;</hi> and at this day all the modern Jews allow ſuch an one to have been. I omit citing their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities for proving that which I think no man ever denied of what Religion ſoever; but if there be any ſuch, I have ſaid enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince any man in this particular.</p>
            <p>The fourth thing I lay down is, That this <hi>Jeſus</hi> that did come,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Theſis</hi> 4.</note> did come about that time the Jews expected him, and did anſwer all the Propheſies concerning the Meſſias. Now to prove this particularly will take up more time then the brevity I aim at will afford me: And therefore I ſhall only touch at ſome of the moſt eminent marks that were to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and follow the Meſſias, which happened about that time, and were verified in our Jeſus.</p>
            <p>Firſt, For the time; and this will appear by ſeveral Propheſies that aſſigne the time of the Meſſias coming.</p>
            <p>The firſt conſiderable Propheſie that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns the time of the Meſſias coming is <hi>Jacob</hi>'s predictions, on his death-bed, of the Tribe of <hi>Judah, That the Scepter ſhall not depart from</hi> Judah, <hi>nor the Lawgiver from between his feet, until</hi> Shiloh <hi>come, and unto him ſhall this ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of the people be.</hi> If by <hi>Shiloh</hi> in this place be meant the Meſſias, then either this Prediction muſt be falſe, which to ſay is blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:58269:26"/>or elſe this Meſſias muſt be come. Now that by <hi>Shiloh</hi> is underſtood the Meſſias, we have the confeſſion of the ancient Jews. Rabbi <hi>Johanam</hi> asking what was the name of the Meſſias, they of the School of Rabbi <hi>Schila</hi> anſwered his Name is <hi>Shiloh,</hi> according to that which is written, <hi>until</hi> Shiloh <hi>come.</hi> The <hi>Cabaliſts</hi> tell us that in <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Meſſias venit</hi> there are the ſame numerical letters that are in <gap reason="foreign">

               </note> and therefore they ſo interpret it. And both <hi>Onkelos Jonathans Targum,</hi> and the <hi>Hieruſalems Targum</hi> for <hi>Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loh</hi> puts <hi>Meſſiah: Hoornbeck</hi> in his foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned tract,<note place="margin">De Con. et Con. Judaeis. <hi>li. 2. pa. 128.</hi>
               </note> reckons the concurrence of divers Rabbies to this interpretation of <hi>Shiloh.</hi> Rabbi <hi>Beehai,</hi> Rabbi <hi>Selomo Jaxtis</hi> on this place, Rabbi <hi>Moſes Gerundenſis,</hi> Rabbi <hi>Joeb ben Sueb Abrunevel apud Menaſſem in Com. ad hunc locum.</hi> All which Authorities aſſure us, That the Jews underſtood that propheſie of the Meſſias, and that [<hi>until</hi> Shiloh <hi>come</hi>] is no more but until the Meſſias come. I am in this kind of Learning no waies verſed, and therefore am forced to take the Authorities as I find them quoted; but from them all this I muſt gather, That the Ancient Jews ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge this to be a Propheſie of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias; which, if ſo, muſt evidently aſſure us he muſt be come: And that our Jeſus did come before the Jews politie was deſtroyed, theſe Jews that tell us he did come, do aſſure us withal, That he was accuſed by the <hi>Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drim,</hi> and ſuffered under <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> when
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:58269:27"/>as yet their Government was not diſſolved.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A ſecond conſiderable Propheſie of the Meſſias was, That he ſhould come whileſt the ſecond Temple ſtood. This is educed out of two places in the Prophets. The firſt is that of <hi>Malachi</hi> 3. <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>Behold I will ſend my Meſſenger, and he will prepare my way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me; and the Lord whom ye ſeek ſhall ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly come to his Temple, even the Meſſenger of the Covenant whom ye delight in: Behold he ſhall come, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is that of the Prophet <hi>Haggai, Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>For thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts; Yet once it is but a little while, and I will ſhake the Heavens and the Earth, and the Sea, and the dry Land.</hi> v. 8. <hi>And I will ſhake all Nations, and the deſire of all Nations ſhall come, and I will fill this Houſe with glory, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> v. 10. <hi>The glory of this latter Houſe ſhall be greater then that of the former, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts: And in this place will I give peace, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> Now from theſe Propheſies 'tis moſt evident the Meſſias was to come whileſt this ſecond Temple ſtood; For elſe what doth the Prophet <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachi</hi> mean when he tells us, <hi>The Lord whom ye ſeek ſhall come to his Temple?</hi> Or how can <hi>Haggai</hi> be underſtood, <hi>That the glory of the latter Houſe ſhall be greater then that of the former?</hi> unleſs the greatneſs of it conſiſted in the preſence of the Meſſias; For alas we know, thoſe that returned from the Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and ſaw the former Houſe, were ſo far
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:58269:27"/>from rejoycing to ſee this latter, that they wept to ſee it ſo far to fall in its magnificence, as <hi>Ezra</hi> tells us in his <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 12. The Jews themſelves (to make this clearer) have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved five ſigns of the glory of the firſt Temple, all which were wanting in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond. The <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> by which the High Prieſt was miraculouſly taught the Will of God; The Ark of the Covenant from whence God gave his anſwers by a clear and audible voice; The fire on the Altar which came down from Heaven, and conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Sacrifices; The Divine preſence or Habitation with them repreſented by a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble appearance, or given as it were to the King or High Prieſt by annointing with Oyl of Unction: And laſtly, the Spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, with which thoſe eſpecially who were called to the Spirit of Propheſie were endued withal. I need not ſay what extraordinary Priviledges theſe are, they will ſufficiently teach them us themſelves. The building of the ſecond Houſe was poor, nay, as <hi>Haggai</hi> tells us, Nothing. Mark his words. <hi>Who is left among you that ſaw this Houſe in her firſt glory? O how do you ſee it now! Is it not in your eyes in compariſon Nothing?</hi> Now is it poſſible any thing can make this poor deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable ſecond Houſe to overtop in glory that former, ſtately, and God-inhabited Temple; unleſs it be the viſible, and bodily appearing of God himſelf in it, unleſs the Meſſias, the deſire of all Nations, the Eternal Son, yet
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:58269:28"/>Equal God, ſhould exhibite himſelf perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally and adorn this Houſe. But what need I ſay ſo much to confirm this Propheſie, when <hi>Manaſſe Ben Iſrael,</hi> as <hi>Hoornbeck</hi> teacheth me, confeſſeth; That <hi>Rabbi David Kimki,</hi>

               <hi>R.

The Exceptions of ſome Jews to this place, are ſo very frivolous, that I omitt them wholly, but you may ſee them ſufficiently refuted by <hi>Hoornbeck</hi> in the place before mentioned. I think now it is evinced that Chriſt muſt come, whileſt this Temple ſtood, this Temple is utterly ruined, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is come; and that before it was rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned our Saviour did come, not only the Jews, who tell us he was crucified by <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi>

            <p n="3">3. A third conſiderable Propheſie is that of the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> which expreſly points at the time of the Meſſias coming, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curres with our Jeſus; the place is the 9. <hi>Cha. v.</hi> 24. <hi>Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people, and upon thy holy City to finiſh the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, and to make an end of ſins, and to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:58269:28"/>make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlaſting righteouſneſs, and to ſeal up the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Propheſie, and to annoint the moſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> v. 25. <hi>Know therefore and underſtand, that from the going forth of the Commandment to reſtore and to build</hi> Hieruſalem <hi>unto the Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah the Prince, ſhall be ſeven weeks, and three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and two weeks; the ſtreet ſhall be built again, and the wall even in troublous times.</hi> v. 26. <hi>And after threeſcore and two weeks ſhall Meſſiah be cut off, but not for himſelf; and the People of the Prince that ſhall come ſhall deſtroy the City, and the Sanctuary, and the end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhall be with a flood, and unto the end of the War deſolations are determined.</hi> v. 27. <hi>And he ſhall confirm the Covenant with many for one week, and in the midſt of the week, he ſhall cauſe the Sacrifice, and Oblation to ceaſe, and for the overſpreading of Abominations he ſhall make it deſolate even until the Conſummation, and that determined ſhall be poured upon the deſolate.</hi> This Propheſie I ſuppoſe is clearly meant of the Meſſiah, becauſe here we have not only his Name, but his Sufferings, and the account of his Sufferings, not for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf but the People. If now this be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie of the Meſſias, as hereafter I ſhall ſhew you the ancient Jews confeſs, then this Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias muſt both be come, and cut off before the final deſtruction of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> whoſe final deſtruction the very Jews, were they not perfectly blind, muſt ſee was that of <hi>Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſian,</hi> ſince which time they have never had
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:58269:29"/>either the City or Temple. That which is moſt difficult here is, the direct time of the Meſſias cutting off is told us under the name of ſo many weeks,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Leviticus</hi> 25.8.</note> which being put for years, as we may find it ſo uſed in divers places, and ſometimes for days, as the Prophet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf doth in the following Chapter,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dan.</hi> 10.2.</note> doth ſufficiently teach us, that theſe weeks are not to be underſtood literally weeks nor days, becauſe both thoſe periods paſſed without the fulfilling of this Propheſie, but years, which I told you before, the Scripture un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by weeks; and then we ſhall find this propheſie very exactly fulfilled in our Jeſus, allowing only ſome few years which muſt ariſe from the not knowing the certain beginning of this propheſie. I confeſs <hi>Hoorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck</hi> upon this place pleaſeth me well, who having before told us, that the difference in the beginning of them, have cauſed ſome difference in the end; that ſome have ended them in the Meſſiah's Baptiſm, others in his paſſion, others in the deſtruction of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, at laſt concludes with this. Unleſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance you had rather, which I ſuppoſe not much,<note place="margin">Niſi fortè velis cui haud mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum refragor non praecisè ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendas hebdomadas illas, &amp; ante ad juſtum illum annorum numerum, ſed potiùs <gap reason="foreign">

               </note> that theſe weeks are not to be taken pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely and ſtrictly to that juſt number of years, but rather more largely about the number of LXX years, which God in this propheſie retained, not that it ſhould be looked to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:58269:29"/>but with ſome ſimilitude to the LXX years of Captivity. I know there are ſome endeavouring, and with great likelihood probable to effect it, a demonſtration of this propheſie by the Eclipſes; unto theſe I wiſh all ſucceſs imaginable, though thus much me thinks is ſufficient to ſatisfie any rational man, (that the time when exactly to begin not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing known, yet if we reckon backwards from the birth of our Saviour, and find it come very near; and beſides conſider that thoſe events are paſſed which were to follow the Meſſias cutting off) that this propheſie was exactly fulfilled in him. There remains thus only to ſhew, that the Ancient Jews under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood this place of the Meſſiah. (I need ſay nothing that they expected him then, having ſaid ſufficiently of that before.) <hi>Hoornbeck</hi> to this purpoſe tells us, that <hi>R b. Saudia a Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, R. Nahman Gerundenſis,</hi> and divers others expound this place of the Meſſiah; but at laſt he gives <hi>Manaſſe Ben Iſraels</hi> teſtimony, which being very material I ſhall at large quote it out of him. But that I might adde this of the Interpretation of this propheſie;<note place="margin">Verùm ut addam illud inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretationis hujus Prophetiae, variè illa etiam ab hujus aevi Hebraeis explicata eſt: Neque illud mirum cuique videri de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet, ſi in Prophetia tam obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra varient ſententiae.

Atque hoc quidem opinati ſunt omnes qui arma tunc temporis adverſus Romanos ſuſceperunt: At licèt multis aerumnis &amp; laboribus obnoxii eſſent, ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilominus tamen ſemper ſpem ſuam in venturo Meſſia poſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt, quippe putârunt eum mediis in aerumnis conspectum ſui praebiturum eſſe. Quare verba haec, ad conſummandum praevaricationem, ita expoſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erunt: Ut poſt expirationem LXX hebdomadum peccata re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitterentur. <hi>De termino vitae, p. 175. Hoorn. p. 169.</hi>
               </note> for this is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly expounded by the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews of this Age: Neither let this be a wonder to any if there be difference of opinions in ſo obſcure a propheſie. There are therefore thoſe who take theſe 70 weeks ſo, that they ſay after
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:58269:30"/>the end of them the Meſſiah is to come, who would conſtitute the Jews Lords of the whole Earth. And this truly all thoſe did imagine that took arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Roman Emperour: And although they were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to many miſeries and labours, yet notwithſtanding they always placed their hope in the Meſſias that was to come, becauſe they thought he would afford the ſight of himſelf when they were in the midſt of their miſeries; wherefore theſe words, <hi>to finiſh the Tranſgreſſions,</hi> they expounded; that after the expiration of 70 weeks ſins are pardoned. I think if a Chriſtian had writ theſe words, he could not more ingenuouſly have confeſſed the truth. We have here an evident Teſtimony that the Jews that lived about the time of the deſtruction of <hi>Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> looked for the Meſſias then to come, becauſe they thought <hi>Daniels</hi> period was ended; and though (as I have often told you) they expected a temporal Prince, yet they thought this propheſie did concern the time when he ſhould come. So that to ſhut up this Argument, we evidently knowing even by their confeſſion, that our Jeſus did come a little before that time that he was cut off; and that the Jews thought <hi>Daniels</hi> period then out, at which period they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:58269:30"/>him, may be ſufficiently aſſured, that our Meſſias came about the time the Jews ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected him. So much for the time touching the Propheſies which were fulfilled in him. The ſecond branch of this poſition I ſhall briefly ſhew; the brevity I aim at not afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me liberty to name all, but the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For the Propheſies, That they were ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in our Saviour.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt Propheſie of note concerning our Saviour, was the Propheſie of his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner, <hi>Elias</hi> was to come. This we have propheſied by <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and <hi>Malachy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.3: <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Jo.</hi> 1.21.</note> and we find verified in <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> as our Saviour tells us. 'Tis true, he denies himſelf to be <hi>Elias,</hi> that is, to be the individual <hi>Elias</hi> the <hi>Thesbite,</hi> whom the Jews ſuppoſed ſhould be born again, when <hi>John</hi> came only in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of <hi>Elias.</hi> Now that there was ſuch an one <hi>Joſephus</hi> in his Annals confeſſeth, and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over adds, That amongſt the Jews there was an opinion that <hi>Herods</hi> Army was by a juſt judgment of God deſtroyed,<note place="margin">Apud Judaeos autem fuit opinio juſta ultione numinis deletum <hi>Herodis</hi> exercitum propter <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hannem</hi> qui <hi>Baptiſts</hi> cognomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus eſt.

               </note> by reaſon of <hi>John</hi> who was named the <hi>Baptiſt;</hi> for this good man the Tetrarch ſlew, who incited the Jews to ſtudy Virtue, and moſt principally Piety and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and withal to come to be baptized. And ſo he proceeds, telling <hi>John Baptiſts</hi> Authority, and the fear
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:58269:31"/>that <hi>Herod</hi> had of him, by reaſon of the great concourſe of people that followed him upon the account of his piety.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond propheſie I look on as moſt remarkable is that of the Prophet <hi>Eſay, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord himſelf ſhall give you a ſign.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 7.11.14.</note>
               <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a Virgin ſhall conceive and bear a ſon, and ſhall call his name</hi> Immanuel. That this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie concerned our Saviour, his birth is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to aſſure us; but that we may clearly underſtand it, here are three things to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered. Firſt, That the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies a Virgin, and not any woman. Secondly, That the other exceptions of the Jews againſt this Propheſie are frivolous. And that our Saviour was born of a Virgin.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, briefly the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is but ſeven times in the Old Teſtament, three times with the Affix <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and alwaies ſignifies a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin. <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſervant uſeth this word in his prayer, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. and certainly he deſired a Virgin for his Maſter <hi>Iſaac;</hi> beſides, in ver. 16 we find the Scripture telling us <hi>Rebecca</hi> knew no man, and yet ſhe is called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. I repeat not the ſeveral places for brevity. The only place which the Jews urge that ſignifies an Harlot, is <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.18, 19. The words are theſe, <hi>There are three things which are too won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful for me, yea, four which I know not;</hi> (ver. 19.) <hi>The way of an Eagle in the Air; the way of a Serpent upon a Rock; the way of a Ship in the midſt of the Sea; and the way of a Man with a Maid.</hi> Now this they will not allow
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:58269:31"/>to be a Maid, but an Harlot, becauſe in the verſe following the way of an adultereſs wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is deſcribed: <hi>Such is the way of an Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſs woman, ſhe eateth and wipeth her mouth, and ſaith, I have done no wickedneſs.</hi> And this <hi>Manaſſe Ben Iſrael</hi> and all the Jews object.</p>
            <p>In anſwer to this, it is not a neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, though the twentieth verſe ſpeaks of an Adultereſs woman, therefore the nineteenth muſt: But on the other ſide, the obſcureneſs to be known rather perſwades it to be a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin than a Whore, whoſe Actions are too common to be obſcure. I am ſure, that the word moſt properly ſignifies a Virgin may be educed of the Etymology, it being derived from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

As for the place we have now in hand, 'tis impoſſible it ſhould be ſo interpreted: For the Lord here promiſeth a ſign to the whole houſe of Iſrael. Now can it be imagined, that a woman ſhould bear a ſon, ſhould be a ſign? A ſign muſt have ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of wonder in it; and is that at all wonderful? The Text it ſelf will perſwade us to underſtand it of a Virgin. But upon what account is this not to be underſtood of a
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:58269:32"/>Virgin? Is it a miracle above the power of Omnipotency? Is it impoſſible for God, who made all things out of nothing, to make a Woman conceive without a Man? The Jews themſelves believe, That God made <hi>Adam</hi> out of the Earth, <hi>Eve</hi> out of <hi>Adams</hi> ſide; the Jews themſelves tell us, that <hi>Aarons</hi> Rod bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomed without root; and is this at all more a wonder then any of theſe? let any indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent perſon judge. But however our modern Jews interpret it, the Ancients did it by Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, as <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> anſwers <hi>Tryphou</hi> the Jew,<note place="margin">Dial. cum Try. Jud. p. 243.</note> and as their own Nation in the Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gint Tranſlation renders it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which can ſignifie nothing elſe; and the holy Rabbi <hi>Hakadoth</hi> tells us, the Meſſias mother muſt be a Virgin, and her name <hi>Mary,</hi> as he gathered out of the Cabaliſts.<note place="margin">3 Queſt. in Eſay 9.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, To this firſt exception the Jews add two or three more, which I repeat, that I may make the way clear before me.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, How the birth of our Saviour by a Virgin, which was to come ſo many ages after, could be a ſign to <hi>Ahaz</hi> and the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for his delivery. Unto which is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, firſt, that not only the exhibiting of a ſign, but the promiſing of a ſign to come hereafter is ſufficient. God had often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed a Meſſias; but how he ſhould be born was not yet foretold; Now the foretelling of that may be a ſign. Beſides another, and a more apparent promiſe of the Meſſias coming, though many ages to follow, might evidently
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:58269:32"/>teach them, that God, who would ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully then ſave his people, would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to be ruined by their enemies. Now, of this we have ſome examples; I will name but one or two. <hi>Samuel</hi> gave <hi>Saul</hi> a ſign of his being Anointed King, that it was from God, becauſe when he was gone from him, at <hi>Rachels</hi> Sepulchre,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 10.1, 2, 3</note> he ſhould find men that would tell him his fathers Aſſes were found. And ſo the ſign that God gave <hi>Eli</hi> of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of his Family, was,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 2.34.</note> that his two Sons, <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phineas,</hi> ſhould both die in a day. The Jews ſecond exception is, becauſe our Saviours Name was not <hi>Emanuel.</hi> To this is anſwered, 'Tis not neceſſary his Name ſhould be <hi>Emanuel,</hi> ſince his nature was ſo, ſince he was <hi>God with us,</hi> as his name ſignifies. And that names often ſhew the nature, we have a moſt remarkable example in the ſame Prophet, of the Meſſias alſo; in his ninth cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter, ver. 6. he tells us, <hi>His Name ſhall be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Wonderful Counſellor, the Everlaſting Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Prince of Peace;</hi> which Title will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, to every eye, a deſcription of the nature, not of the name of the Meſſias. The laſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception is concerning the words following this Propheſie, which are, <hi>Butter and Milk ſhall be eat,</hi> and how they are verified in our Saviour: in which there is no repugnancy, but that he ſhould be educated as other Children are; and that before the Child ſhould know either good or evil, the enemies of <hi>Judaea</hi> ſhall be deſtroyed.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:58269:33"/> 3. That our Saviour was born of a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin. Againſt the Jews I have this to ſay; That we have the ſame, and as great Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, nay greater then they have, to prove the Miracles of <hi>Moſes</hi> or any of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets: For what Authority beſides the Books of Scripture, and the conſtant atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of their own Nation in ſeveral Ages, can the Jews produce? And have not we much more? That our Saviour ſhould be born of a Virgin I have ſhewed you was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied; That he was born of a Virgin, we have the four Evangeliſts to atteſt it; and in anſwer to the conſtant Tradition of their ſingle Nation for their Miracles, we have the conſtant witneſs of all Chriſtians, not only of one but of every Nation, nay of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed Jews. The firſt publiſhers of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity were Jews, and they witneſſed this; ſo that we have part of their Nation divided againſt themſelves: And that the Chriſtians always believed this, the Articles of their Creed will inform us. Now if the Jews think it reaſonable we ſhould believe the Miracles of their Prophets, have they not the ſame, or greater reaſon to believe this miraculous Birth of our Saviour? But to this let me adde; Secondly, If the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was not a Virgin when ſhe brought forth our Saviour, why was ſhe not puniſhed for an Adultereſs? For <hi>Joſeph</hi> we know de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied Jeſus to be his Son, the Law command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an Adultereſs to be put to death, the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:58269:33"/>Jews wanted not malice to have proſecuted her, nor (had ſhe been guilty) will to have puniſhed her. If in this particular there had been the leaſt of fault in this bleſſed Virgin, the Phariſees had had too great an advantage to have let it ſlip. <hi>Joſeph</hi> might eaſily have been the Plaintiff, the Phariſees her Enemies the Judges, and yet we ſee her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched, becauſe immaculate and without ſpot. Now is not this a more then probable Argument to convince a man of this truth. If we conſider the fury and malice the Jews proſecuted our Saviour with, the hatred they bore the Apoſtles, the perſecutions they raiſed againſt all Chriſtians, can we ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally ſuppoſe this bleſſed Virgin the Mother of our Jeſus, ſhould paſs without their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, had they not been aſſured of the truth of her Virginity, and believed their further enquiries would have advanced the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans Faith, and aboliſhed theirs? But in the third place let me adde what <hi>Suidas</hi> tells me of the great Secret <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Jew told <hi>Philip</hi> a Chriſtian Merchant concerning our Saviour; which being too large here to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat, I ſhall contract the ſum of it into as few words as I can. In the time of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Jnſtinian,</hi> there was one <hi>Theodoſius</hi> a chief man amongſt the Jews, that was inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate with <hi>Philip</hi> a Chriſtian Merchant: This intimacie being great between them, <hi>Philip</hi> attempted, out of the love he bare him, to convert him to Chriſtianity; which <hi>Theode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:58269:34"/>ſeeing, and perceiving this attempt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded meerly out of the affection he bore to him, told him plainly, that it was vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory and ambition were the only cauſe kept him a Jew, that he was a chief man amongſt his people, when amongſt Chriſtians he ſhould be inconſiderable; but yet withal he told him, that out of gratitude to him he would reveal a Secret of his Nation, which would be very advantagious to the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion. In the Temple of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> (ſaith he) there were 22 Ordinary Prieſts, out of which number when any died the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der proceeded to the Election of another: One of the number dying, the Survivours, according to their cuſtome, proceeded to an Election, and divers being named, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for their manners or abilities not appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of, at laſt one of the youngeſt amongſt them having liberty to ſpeak, propoſed <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> the Son of <hi>Joſeph</hi> the Carpenter, who was inferiour to none but in age, nay excell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them all; Againſt our Saviour there was only this Objection, that he was not of the Tribe of <hi>Levi, Joſeph</hi> being of the Tribe of <hi>Judah;</hi> unto which was replyed, that anciently the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> did intermingle one amongſt another, ſo that <hi>Joſeph</hi> was of both Tribes; which anſwer being ſatisfactory they all concurred in him. Now it being the cuſtome upon the Regiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Prieſts name, to ſet down both his Fathers and Mothers name, they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:58269:34"/>before by the Propoſer of him, that his Father <hi>Joſeph</hi> was dead, thought fit to ſend for <hi>Mary</hi> his Mother, to examine her if he was her Son, and to underſtand the name of her husband; which being done <hi>Mary</hi> came to them, and they telling her the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of Regiſtring both the name of her Son, and of his Parents, demanded whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was her Son: The Virgin anſwered, he is my Son, and there are yet living both men and women that can atteſt it; but for his father he hath none upon earth; and ſo relating the ſtory of the Angels ſaluting her in <hi>Galilaea,</hi> and withal aſſuring them, that notwithſtanding this Birth ſhe was ſtill a Virgin; they thought fit to ſend for faithful Midwives to examine the truth of this. The Midwives being come, found her, as ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, ſtill a Virgin; and withal there came ſome alſo that witneſſed her bearing Jeſus: This amazing them all they deſired the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary</hi> frankly to tell them whoſe Son he was; ſhe told them he was her Son, and the Son of God: Which thing being heard, they fetched out the Book, and wrote down; This day this Prieſt dyed, the Son of this Father and Mother, and by the common conſent of all is put into his place <hi>Jeſus the Son of the living God, and the Virgin</hi> Mary. And this Book (ſaith <hi>Theodoſius</hi>) was kept by the chief of the Jews from being taken at <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and is now preſerved in the City of <hi>Tyberias;</hi> and this was revealed to
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:58269:35"/>me. <hi>Philip</hi> all this while hearing this ſtory, told <hi>Theodoſius</hi> he would acquaint the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour that he might ſend to <hi>Tyberias</hi> and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh this Book, to convince the Jews of their incredulity: Unto which the Jew replyed, 'tis to no end, for the Jews will burn the Book, and you will only by it deſtroy our Nation by Wars, and not obtain your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. This (ſaith he) I tell you that you may believe I have a great affection for you. This ſtory <hi>Suidas</hi> tell us in the name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and that they received it from thoſe to whom <hi>Philip</hi> told it; and withal addes, without he had been nominated and conſtituted a Prieſt, the Jews would not have ſuffered him to have performed any ſacred Office in the Temple. And that he did ſo, <hi>Joſephus</hi> confeſſeth in his Book of the deſtruction of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and <hi>Luke cap.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 16. mentioneth. Thus much <hi>Suidas.</hi> I can ſay nothing more to confirm this Teſtimony, but what theſe excellent Compilers ſay for it themſelves, only thus much; It ſeems too punctual to be forged; and that the learned Reporters firmly belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it, as in the laſt words they tell us, may perſwade us to do ſo too.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Of this Propheſie I have been the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, becauſe I find both from the Atheiſts and Jews ſuch oppoſition to it. I ſhall proceed to name others, and only name them. The Meſſias was to come of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> and of the Family of <hi>David</hi> according to <hi>Eſay</hi>'s Propheſies:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eſay</hi> 11.1, 10.</note>
               <hi>There ſhall come forth a
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:58269:35"/>Rod out of the ſtemme of</hi> Jeſſe, <hi>and a Branch ſhall grow out of his roots, and the Spirit of the Lord ſhall reſt upon him:</hi> And again, <hi>In that day there ſhall be a root of</hi> Jeſſe, <hi>which ſhall ſtand for an Enſign of the people, unto it ſhall the Gentiles ſeek, and his reſt ſhall be glorious.</hi> Now this we find verified in our Saviour, as the Evangeliſts teach us.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.1 <hi>Hez.</hi> 14.</note> The Meſſias was to be born at <hi>Bethlem,</hi> as we may ſee not only by <hi>Micah</hi>'s propheſie:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Micah</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 2.</note>

            <p>To conclude, It is evident the Meſſias was to ſuffer, and undergo what ſufferings were foretold of him; and of this the Jews them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were no ways ignorant, as may appear by their imagining a double Meſſias, the one a ſuffering, the other a conquering Prince; the one the ſon of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> the other the ſon of <hi>David;</hi> the one was to be ſlain, fighting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> the other, ſucceeding him, was to obtain the Kingdom: Theſe dreams the <hi>Targum</hi> in <hi>Zach.</hi> 9.9. and in <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy</hi> 3.1. <hi>Jarchi Abravanel,</hi> and all the Jews expound to us, as <hi>Hoornbeck</hi> teacheth me;<note place="margin">li. 3. ca. 1. p. 240.</note> and that remarkable place in <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. <hi>They pierced my hands and my feet,</hi> they underſtand
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:58269:38"/>of their <hi>Meſſias Ben Joſeph.</hi> The whole ſtory of this Meſſias of theirs you may find repeated by <hi>Hoornheck;</hi> but 'tis too large, and too fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous for me to tranſcribe out of him; All that from the premiſes I can gather is this, That the Jews, rather than they would ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine the ſon of <hi>David</hi> to be a ſpiritual Prince, rather then they would believe they ſhould not temporally be delivered, and through the conduct of the Meſſias conquer the Earth; and by no means knowing how to ſolve thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions which foretel his ſufferings, would feign a double Meſſias, of which there is no footſteps in Scripture. So that this advantage we Chriſtians have, to prove that our Saviour (having both done and ſuffered whatever was foretold of the Meſſias; nay, in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts far exceeded what the greateſt earthly Conquerour ever reached to, by ſubduing that which overcame them all, even Death it ſelf) ought to be admitted as the only Meſſias of the world; and the Jews, if their Infidelity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted not to obſtinacy, muſt neceſſarily be convinced, that he who was able to perform what, and more then they expected of their double Meſſias, ought to be received as the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Saviour of the world.</p>
            <p>The fifth Theſis I lay down is this,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Theſis</hi> 5.</note> That the Religion delivered by Jeſus Chriſt is, where it is not above reaſon, moſt reaſonable, and upon the Principles of Reaſon ought to be admitted: Where it is above the reach of Reaſon, and depends upon the Authority of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:58269:38"/>the Lawgiver, is confirmed by miracles, which, carrying Omnipotency, and Gods Seal perpetually annexed to them, need not deſire but command admittance.</p>
            <p>I have here a Theam ſo large, that to handle every part of it will require a far greater length in this diſcourſe then I aim at. I ſhall but touch upon the firſt part of this Theſis, and handle that of Miracles more largely; and my reaſon is, becauſe I find Miracles may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade men when Arguments cannot. <hi>Caligula</hi> feared not the Gods till they thundered; and fear is ſuch a paſſion that it always perſwades more then the greateſt Rhetorick. For our underſtanding this, we muſt conſider there are two ſorts of Precepts, Natural, and Poſitive. The firſt of theſe Nature imprints in every man; the ſecond are thoſe that each Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver, upon his own Authority, in joyns his Diſciples. The firſt of theſe we are bound to do, as men; the ſecond, as Chriſtians. The firſt of theſe we are bound to obſerve, becauſe to that end we were created; The ſecond, which we admit upon the authority of the Lawgiver, we are to obey upon the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and for that very account as we admit him our Lawgiver; and ſo that which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades us to be ſuch an ones Diſciples, muſt perſwade us to obey his poſitive Commands. And ſo upon this ſcore we ought to believe thoſe future rewards which are promiſed. Now though theſe poſitive Precepts and Promiſes, our bleſſed Saviour hath taught us, are in the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:58269:39"/>commands moſt excellent, and in the rewards, to a rational Soul moſt (nay only) ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and ſo upon that account carry along with them ſtrength enough to perſwade obedience; yet thoſe ſeveral confirmations of the miracles which forced the world to be Chriſts Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, muſt alſo force it to obey what he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and to believe what he promiſeth.</p>
            <p>Theſe Natural Precepts are that Law which all the world have ever been obliged to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, whether you will call them the ſeven Precepts of <hi>Noah,</hi> or the Ten Commandments, or reduce them, as our Saviour doth, into two Commandements,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.37, 39.</note>
               <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul, and all thy mind; and thou ſhalt love thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as thy ſelf.</hi> For to him that ponders them it will appear, that they are all but one and the ſame Law; and that each of theſe Precepts natural Reaſon it ſelf will perſwade us to obey. And though in the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement the poſitive time of ſerving God is by many believed a peculiar injunction, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to that Nation; as alſo that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular exhibition of this Law, as it is delivered in <hi>Exodus</hi> 20. is upon the ſame account: Yet all theſe Commandments containing in them nothing but what is natural, and obliged the world before this delivery; and the fourth containing in it that which all Nations that ever owned a God, practiſed; to wit, that ſome time muſt be ſet apart for his ſervice, do ſufficiently aſſure us they are but another Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:58269:39"/>or ſetting forth of that Law which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teacheth every man to obſerve. Now becauſe the ten Commandments ſeem to be the largeſt copy of this natural Law, I ſhall briefly examine them, and ſhall ſhew you that reaſon commands them to be obeyed upon na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural principles.</p>
            <p>That there is a God, is a thing ſo natural that there never yet was any Nation that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not ſome Deity or other. There have been Nations found out that lived without Laws; but never any that lived without Gods. Divers Nations have lived without King, and without houſe, going ſtark naked, and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring like wild beaſts, from place to place, to find their ſuſtenance; yet none of theſe but have had ſome ſpice of Religion, ſome God or other they ſerved: From whence it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, That it is more natural to believe there is a God, than for a man to be a ſociable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, than for a man by cloaths to preſerve himſelf from the injury of weather, or by houſes to fix himſelf in a ſetled condition.</p>
            <p>The next gradation I follow, is, That there is or can be but one God. For if God be Omnipotent, there can be but one Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent Power, becauſe two Omnipotents cannot ſubſiſt together. And the reaſon is, Either their Wills are different, or alike; If different, then upon the principle of Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency, each of their Wills muſt ſubſiſt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which is impoſſible: If alike, then up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:58269:40"/>what reaſon can a man imagine there ſhould be more Omnipotency, which one if he be Omnipotent can effect? 'Tis a Maxime in Nature, <hi>That it is in vain to do that by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny which we can do by few.</hi> This poſition hath in the world had a great, though not an Univerſal conſent. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> affirmed it, as <hi>Cicero</hi> tells me. <hi>Socrates</hi> was forced to drink poyſon for the belief of one God, as <hi>Agellius</hi> tells me: And <hi>Plato Socrates</hi>'s Scholar in his 13 <hi>Ep.</hi> to <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the King of <hi>Sicily,</hi> (if the Epiſtle be his, and if not, 'tis as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient) telling the King that he was by many put upon writing, which he could not eaſily avoid; at laſt gave him this Note to know his Epiſtles by. My ſerious Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles <hi>God</hi> begin,<note place="margin">

            <p>If then there be but one God, one Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent power, who is the Authour and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver of all things, then it is moſt reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that this one God, and this God alone ſhould be ſerved. The reaſon of homage and ſervice is meerly a grateful return for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits received: Now if all that we are and have come from this God, ought we not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſerve and to do our homage to him? We count it amongſt us impoſſible for a man to ſerve two Maſters, and can we ſuppoſe it poſſible or rational for a man to joyn Idols, and Creatures, thoſe things which in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:58269:40"/>are inferiour to us, in our ſacred ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of God? The reaſon why we ſerve God is, becauſe he is that Omnipotent pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which made us, the Authour of our being and preſervation, and can we believe it aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for us to divide our ſervices between an impotent Creature and an Omnipotent God; to ſhare our Devotions with the work of our own hands, which are ſo far from preſerving us, that it is in our power to deſtroy them.</p>
            <p>To proceed, as this God is only to be ſerved, ſo upon the former account it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious for us to ſpeak ſlightly of him, of his Name, and of his Attributes. The Name of God commands awe and reverence. See what Devotions and dread the Heathens bore to their ſuppoſed Gods, and ſhall not we do much more to the true? But certainly 'tis moſt rational not to uſe the Name of God, and call his Majeſty to be a witneſs to our fooliſh Oaths, much leſs to our perjuries. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; And ſo our Saviour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds this third Commandment. This laſt is a ſin, as I have often thought with my ſelf, that flies in the face of God, nay, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies him to be a God: For certainly he that uſeth Gods Name, and calls him to be a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſuch a promiſe, by the breaking of it doth declare, that God (in whoſe preſence he made it) either did not regard what he promiſeth, or is not able ſeverely to puniſh the non-performance. But to go on; as this God is only to be ſerved, and to be had in
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:58269:41"/>reverence of all that call upon him; ſo it is a neceſſary deduction from the premiſes, that there muſt be ſome time ſet apart for his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. And though I ſhould allow the ſeventh day, nay the ſeventh part of our time to be a Law particular to that Jewiſh Nation; yet certainly if the Jews, who lived under the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of ſo many Ceremonies, and deſired to ſee even that which we enjoy, were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to ſet apart ſo much of their time, as a ſeventh part for Gods Service; 'tis not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable for us who have received more to do leſs; but as we exceed them in mercies, ſo we ought to exceed them in our Services.</p>
            <p>Thus we may ſee the firſt Table contains in it nothing elſe but what he that will be ruled by reaſon muſt be forced to obey. That which the ſecond Table enjoyns us are duties that concern our ſelves; ſo that theſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples muſt appear rational even to <hi>Atheiſts</hi> and <hi>Scepticks,</hi> becauſe in the obſervation of them ſociety is upheld, propriety maintained, and men are prevented for degenerating into Beaſts.</p>
            <p>Theſe Commands are in number 6. the firſt an affirmative Precept, the laſt 5 Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. The firſt five are ſo natural, that I ſhall forbear to ſay any thing of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he that conſiders them muſt know, they are that Pale of Commutative and Diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Juſtice which preſerves Mankind from deſtroying themſelves. The laſt, <hi>Thou ſhalt not covet,</hi> ſeems to carry in it ſomewhat more
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:58269:41"/>then Nature teacheth; but I think upon due examination it will appear otherwiſe: For to deſire another mans goods when we know we cannot have them, muſt either put us up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unjuſt endeavours for them, or elſe tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture our minds that we cannot obtain them. If now Nature it ſelf teach us to do as we would be done to, if we would not have others covet what we have, we muſt not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet what is another mans. The great Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction againſt the Naturality of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, is from that Speech of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle; <hi>I had not known luſt except the Law had ſaid; Thou ſhalt not covet.</hi> I ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat you many Expoſitions of the place, <hi>Beza</hi> alone ſhall ſerve the turn. What therefore (ſaith he) the Apoſtle addes,<note place="margin">Quid igitur ſubjecit Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus ſeſe ex illo demum legis il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius divinitus latae praecepto di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciſſe, Cupiditatem eſſe pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum, non eſt ſimpliciter &amp; abſolutè accipiendum, ſed du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plici respectu, viz. tam quate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus in illa divinitus latâ lege expreſſiùs omnis Cupiditas damnatur, quàm illa naturali lege, tum quod vitiofitas illa noſtra Cupiditatem noſtram quo apertiùs reprehendit co ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hementiùs incendit.</note> that he at laſt learnt that Covetouſneſs was a ſin, out of that precept of that divine Law, is not ſimply or abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to be taken, but in a double reſpect; <hi>viz.</hi> as in that divine given Law all Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is more expreſly condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed then in that Natural Law, then becauſe our vitioſity, by how much it openly reproves our Covetouſneſs, by ſo much it more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently enflames it. But I need not preſs this nor any other Expoſition, if to love our Neighbours as our ſelf be a natural Precept, ſince the Apoſtle tells us in the ſame Epiſtle:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 9.</note>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:58269:42"/>
               <hi>For this, Thou ſhalt not commit adultery, Thou ſhalt not kill, Thou ſhalt not ſteal, Thou ſhalt not bear falſe witneſs, Thou ſhalt not covet: And if there be any other Commandement, it is briefly comprehended in this ſaying, namely, Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf.</hi> Thus briefly I have examined theſe Natural Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour that great and moſt excellent Law-giver hath advanced them higher. Now becauſe theſe advancements are to be evinced out of Reaſon, I ſhall not preſs their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon the authority of the Law-giver. I ſhall name the chief of them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Commandement <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill, Mat.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 21. to the 27. our Saviour hath advanced to this height, that it prohibites the very being angry with our brother; nay, cauſleſs anger is forbidden, though it go no further then the breaſt, much more if it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the tongue, or fall into violent rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond Commandment that is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced is, <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit Adultery.</hi> Now this our Saviour hath reduced to the very thoughts;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 27.31.</note> we muſt not have an adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous thought. <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> preſſeth the excellency of Chriſtian Religion from this very Command.<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. Ap. 2. p. 48.</note> For he that indeed hath committed adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is not only rejected by our Saviour, but he that hath a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to commit adultery, he that
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:58269:42"/>hath but an adulterous thought.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Another advancement is the taking away the Law of Retaliation and Revenge. This doing good for evil is the excellency of Chriſtian Religion: And in this particular amongſt other things Chriſtianity vaſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled the ſtricteſt Heathen Morality. See what <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith of this point. It is ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile to ſuffer evil treating.<note place="margin">

               <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> alſo in his Book <hi>de Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one</hi> placeth Revenge amongſt Natural Principles. <hi>Ad Atticum</hi> he ſaith, I hate the man,<note place="margin">Odi hominem, &amp; odero, uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam ulciſci poſſem. <hi>Et in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonium.</hi> Sic ulciſcar facinora ſingula quemadmodum à qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſque ſum provocatus.</note> and will hate, would I could be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged. And againſt <hi>Anthony;</hi> So I will revenge every wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, according to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as I am provoked.</p>
            <p>Under theſe three heads are comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the advancements our Saviour hath put upon this Moral Law; and let us exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine them, and we ſhall find them highly reaſonable, and not only ſo, but moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent: For that which makes the Subject moſt pure, and moſt happy, hath in it ſelf the greateſt reaſon to command obedience.</p>
            <p>Now upon this foundation let us examine the two firſt, which forbids murderous and adulterous thoughts, as well as the actions. Are not theſe thoughts the cauſes of the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? and is there any poſſibility totally to take away the effect, if we remove not the cauſe? Beſides every man conſiſts of a Soul
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:58269:43"/>and a body; by actions the body is defiled, the contamination that accrues tothe Soul is from the thoughts, where every wickedneſs is hatched before it is produced to act: Now is there not more reaſon to keep the Soul pure then the body, in as much as it is the moſt excellent part of men? and that if we keep out wickedneſs there, we ſhall keep the body from acting it. If Nature then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to abſtain from ſuch actions, doth it not command us to abſtain from the cauſes of them? If Nature teacheth purity in the body the worſer part, doth it not require it upon greater reaſon in the more excellent part? I can but touch theſe things. The third is, the taking away Revenge, and not only that, but a returning good for evil. And is it not in it ſelf the greateſt victory to make our enemies acknowledge they have wronged us? Injuries, <hi>Tacitus</hi> tells us, <hi>Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitae videntur, ſpretae exoleſcunt;</hi> they are ſeen by our taking notice of them, but va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh if we deſpiſe them. Was this counſel for a Heathen, and is it rational for a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to ſtudy Revenge? Conſider the nature of it: Revenge is a deſire to do another an injury, becauſe he ſerved me ſo. Very good reaſon. Then if a wicked man hath robbed me, I muſt turn Thief too to rob him; If I have been reviled and railed at, I muſt do ſo too. There is in every Revenge that which in it ſelf is unjuſt: For 'tis the injuries and unjuſt actions a man hath done, that puts in
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:58269:43"/>the party injured a deſire of revenge: Now to be revenged of him is to ſerve him ſo too, to do him the like or a worſe turn: Is not this a rare foundation to advance humanity on? But on the other ſide, let us conſider, what great advantages we obtain by doing good for evil; now that which is moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious to Mankind, is moſt natural and reaſonable: For beſides that we ſhall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come our Enemies by heaping Coals of fire upon his head, we ſhall obtain peace with all men; what man will wrong us that do good to all, and injure none? If (ſaith <hi>Tertullian</hi>) we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to love our Enemies,<note place="margin">Si inimicos jubemur diligere, quem habemus odiſſe? Item ſi laeſi vicem referre prohibemur, nec de facto pares ſumus, quem poſſumus laedere? <hi>Apol. cap. 36.</hi>
               </note> whom have we to hate? If we are forbidden to revenge our injuries, we cannot by our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be equal with them whom we may hurt. Is not now this principle moſt reaſonable, which frees us from injuſtice, makes our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies our friends, and eſtabliſheth peace upon laſting foundations? I refer this to any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Judge.</p>
            <p>Theſe Precepts upon the Principles of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being evinced reaſonable, the next thing we muſt conſider is, whether we have obeyed them: For if reaſon commands them, a rational man upon the breach of them muſt acknowledge, he deſerves puniſhment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in ſo doing he hath deſtroyed the end of his Creation, as to God, and the means of his ſubſiſting, as to man.</p>
            <pb n="70" facs="tcp:58269:44"/>
            <p> This his meriting of puniſhment will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear more evident, if we conſider, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame reaſon as he believes there is a God, he muſt believe this God doth either reward or puniſh obedience or diſobedience to that Natural Law which is imprinted in every mans heart. For reward and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are neceſſary Adjuncts to a Deity. The Apoſtle joyns this to the belief of God, as a thing in its own nature inſeparable. Mark his words.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6.</note>
               <hi>For he that cometh to God muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he is, and that he is a Rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him.</hi> And truly if this was not the conſequence of the belief of a God, this belief would have no influence at all upon man or his actions; For if God did neither reward nor puniſh, did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard nor take notice of what was done, what Arguments can be forcible to perſwade men not to obey what ſenſe, rather then what nature and reaſon teacheth?</p>
            <p>This being then true, that the breakers of theſe Natural Laws deſerve puniſhment, and that God will puniſh ſuch; The next thing we muſt conſider is, whether all mankind have not broken theſe Laws; and if ſo, then all mankind juſtly deſerve puniſhment from God. I need not ſay this is the ſtate and condition we are all in, every man in his own heart is ſufficiently conſcious of his own guilt. Now therefore as every man is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated to confeſs he deſerves puniſhment, ſo natural reaſon teacheth us to believe, that
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:58269:44"/>this puniſhment, as to the pain and duration of it, muſt have ſome reſpect to the perſon offended, as well as the perſons offending. Thus to ſtrike a private perſon, and to ſtrike a Magiſtrate are in the actions both evil alike; yet it is moſt juſt that he that ſtrikes a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate ſhould be more ſeverely puniſhed, then he that ſtruck the private perſon. And we ſee the Levitical Law puniſheth the Smiter or Curſer of his Father with death,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.15.17</note> when the ſame crimes againſt other perſons were pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with far leſs ſufferings. So then if we conſider, the perſon we have all offended is God, and adde to this what God is; that there is not any compariſon between man and him, and that he doth by infinite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees far exceed the greateſt ſuperiority a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men; If we conſider the perſon of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended is infinite, and acknowledge that our puniſhment muſt have reſpect to him, we muſt confeſs there is reaſon for an Eternity of puniſhment, and that nothing leſs can ſatisfie Juſtice. I might adde to this, that this eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal puniſhment is more juſtly inflicted upon diſobedience, ſince obedience is rewarded with eternal happineſs; but this is not the buſineſs I am to infiſt on. I ſhall therefore proceed.</p>
            <p>This being the ſtate all Mankind is in, the next thing natural reaſon teacheth us, is to find out a remedy for to free us from this ſad condition. In our ſelves we cannot, becauſe we are the perſons offending, and ſo are unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:58269:45"/>to act any thing that may tend to our recovery. A Murderer though he ſhould ſave a thouſand mens lives, yet ſtill remains a Murderer. What is then to be done? we muſt look out of our ſelves, and ſee whether there is no remedy offered us. Now if there be a way left to free us from this juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved eternal puniſhment, it muſt be by finding out a ſurety, who muſt ſuffer for us, and whoſe ſufferings muſt ſatisfie the perſon offended: For, as I ſaid before, he that ſinnes againſt an Infinite God deſerves infinitely to be puniſhed, becauſe the perſon offended is infinite. So now upon the ſame account I ſay, this Infinite Perſon offended muſt be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, if an Infinite Perſon, God equal with him, becomes our ſurety, and ſuffers for us; and ſo that vaſt debt which in us an eternity of puniſhment could not expiate, in our ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Saviour upon the Croſs was abſolved, becauſe of the infiniteneſs of the perſon ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering. There remains but this to prove; That this Jeſus that did ſuffer is that Infinite God; And withal to ſhew how we may come to have an intereſt in his ſufferings.</p>
            <p>I might here before I proceed refute thoſe falſe Foundations <hi>Turciſme</hi> is builded upon, and ſhew how ridiculous 'tis to ſuppoſe <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> to be a Saviour; but that will run my Diſcourſe to a far greater length then I aim at. I will therefore fall directly upon the Propoſitions before propoſed; and though the firſt in order ought to be firſt proved, yet
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:58269:45"/>becauſe the ſecond brings me to diſcourſe of the Poſitive Laws, according to my firſt Method, and that the proving of the firſt will confirm the ſecond, nay will command us to obey all our Saviours Poſitive Laws, and believe all his promiſes; I ſhall follow that Method, and begin to ſhew how you may have an Intereſt in his Sufferings.</p>
            <p>The only way to get an Intereſt in him, is to follow that way our Saviour that doth the work for us teacheth us; and this brings me directly to treat of thoſe Poſitive Laws, which we admit and obey upon the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Law-giver, and thoſe reaſons that convince us that he is the Law-giver, muſt perſwade us to obey his Laws.</p>
            <p>I ſhall reduce all theſe Poſitive Laws into that one Capital Command; <hi>Believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> This is the Doctrine the Goſpel teacheth us, and this is the way to have an Intereſt in his Sufferings, which doth not only free us from this eternal torment, but rewards us with eternal Glory.</p>
            <p>I might here tell you, if it were poſſible for the tongue of man or Angel to ſpeak it, what great advantages by this Saviour we enjoy: I might preſs the reaſonableneſs of this Command from the Infinite reward that follows it: I might prove to you, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but an Immortal happineſs can ſatisfie an Immortal Soul, and that ſpiritual enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments can only fill our Spirits, when they are
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:58269:46"/>freed from the cloggs of ſin and corruption, which in this world attend our bodies: I might ſhew you, that as the ſpirituality of the Precepts declares the excellency of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity above other Religions in the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence it requireth; ſo the ſpirituality of the promiſes doth evidence the excellency of it in the Rewards that follow it. But for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities ſake I will not particularize on theſe heads, which every pious Chriſtian by his own meditation and diligent conſideration, may for his particular benefit advance to a higher pitch then I am able.</p>
            <p>That which now only remains to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved is, That this Jeſus is this Law-giver, that this Chriſt that did ſuffer is this Infinite God: And this I ſhall do from the ſeveral Arguments that convinced the world to be Chriſtian. I ſhall not here in this Argument keep ſo ſtrictly to the proving Chriſt to be that Law-giver; but I ſhall handle here more largely all the Confirmations, that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert either that propoſition, or confirmed and encreaſed the Chriſtian Faith. And theſe I ſhall reduce to three Heads: Theſe are,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The witneſs of God.</item>
               <item>2. The miraculous power of doing Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles in our Saviour, and by him given to Chriſtians, together with the ſucceſs follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this; The deſtruction of Idolatry, and ſudden Conqueſt of the World.</item>
               <item>3. The holy lives, and wonderful Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Chriſtians. Of each of theſe in order.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:58269:46"/> 1. The witneſs of God. Under this Head I might again repeat thoſe ſeveral Propheſies in the Old Teſtament which then deſigned the Meſſias, and were fulfilled in our Jeſus: I might tell you the Angels Salutation to the bleſſed Virgin,<note place="margin">Luke <hi>1.</hi>
               </note> with his Meſſage ſent from God to her, were both Teſtimonies from God, for the confirmation of Jeſus Chriſt to be that Law-giver, that Meſſias; but for brevities ſake I ſhall omit them, and treat only of thoſe two wonderful witneſſes, the Star that directed the Wiſe men to him, and the Voice from Heaven that before a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude audibly declared him.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the Star that directed the wiſe men to him; we have the whole ſtory <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. and in it we may ſee 'twas not an ordinary but an extraordinary Star: 'Twas a Star the wiſe men ſaw afar off, and as ſoon as they ſaw it knew it deſigned the birth of the King of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dab.</hi> How theſe wiſe men ſhould come to know what this new and Wonderful Star de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned; whether they attained it by a then particular Divine Revelation, or elſe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a Tradition from their Anceſtors, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſuch an appearance, (which perhaps is probable, ſince we find <hi>Baalam,</hi> a Prophet of their own Nation, foretelling that there ſhould come a Star out of <hi>Jacob,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Num.</hi> 24.17.</note> and a Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhall ariſe out of <hi>Iſrael</hi> which ſhould ſmite the corners of <hi>Moab</hi>) I ſhall not diſpute, ſince either of them is ſufficient for my purpoſe. This is moſt certain, this new appearance was
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:58269:47"/>ſo wonderful, that it perſwaded wiſe men to go a long journey to examine the truth of it; and though till their coming to <hi>Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> that City ſeems to have taken no notice of it, yet the truth of it was ſo evident that upon the very Queſtion, <hi>Where is he that was born King of the Jews, for we have ſeen his ſtar in the Eaſt, and are come to worſhip him: Herod</hi> and all the City was troubled. The Prieſts and Scribes were ſent for to inquire where Chriſt ſhould be born, nay, this is not all. When theſe Wiſemen according to Gods direction deceived <hi>Herods</hi> expectation, by their return another way, his anger ends in cruelty, and his paſſion could by no other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine be expiated but by the ſlaughter of all the Children, from two years old and under, about the Coaſts of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> the place they told him that Chriſt ſhould be born. I need not here tell you that this new Star deſigned our Saviour, ſince <hi>Herod</hi> and all the Jews un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood it ſo; ſince, as it brought the wiſe men to <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> ſo it directed them to the place where the babe lay: But I will ſhew you ſome footſteps of this Star amongſt Heathens. Cardinal <hi>Baronius</hi> that Learned Annaliſt, in the firſt year of Chriſt, cites <hi>Calcidius</hi> his Comment on <hi>Plato's Timaeus</hi> for this purpoſe. There is (ſaith <hi>Calcidius</hi>) ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more venerable and holy Hiſtory,<note place="margin">Et quoque alia venerabilior &amp; ſanctior Hiſtoria, quae perhibet de ortu Stellae cujuſdam inſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae non morbos morteſque de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuntiantes, ſed deſcenſum Dei venerabilis ad humanae conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſationis rerumque mortalium gratiam quam Stellam cum no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturno itinere ſuſpexiſſent Chaldaeorum profecto ſapientes viri, &amp; conſideratione rerum Coeleſtium ſatis exercitati quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſſe diountur recentem Dei or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, repertaque illa Majeſtate puerili venerati eſſe, &amp; vota Deo tanto convenientia nuncu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe. <hi>Tom. 1. p. 52.</hi>
               </note> which tells us of the riſe of a certain unwonted Star not denouncing diſeaſes or
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:58269:47"/>death, but the deſcent of the Venerable God, to converſe with men and mortal buſineſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; which Star when theſe wiſe <hi>Chaldeans</hi> clearly ſaw in their night journey, and being enough exerciſed in the confide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of heavenly things, 'tis reported they ſought this New Birth of God, and the Majeſty of this child being found, they worſhipped him, and offered gifts agreeable to ſo great a God. This teſtimony is very clear, and in my opinion hath nothing of difficulty in it, but what is meant by this holy Hiſtory, which without diſpute muſt have reference to thoſe Books of Propheſies which the Chaldeans kept by them. Some are ſo confident to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that <hi>Baalam,</hi> of whom I ſpake before, left them Books of Propheſies, which dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted thoſe <hi>Magi</hi> in difficult caſes; 'tis not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible but he might do ſo; however this is probable, that they received from their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors ſome rules of their knowledge, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with former Obſervations, and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Predictions, which they either pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in Writings or Hieroglyphicks, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which, as I ſuppoſe, <hi>Calcidius,</hi> being a Heathen, by this holy Hiſtory hath reference. To this of <hi>Calcidius,</hi> I might add that which <hi>Macrobius</hi> tells us of the ſlaughter of theſe Children; which though it directly proves not the appearance of the Star, yet it will
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:58269:48"/>ſerve to confirm us in the truth of that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this murder was occaſioned by it. Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> his words are theſe; When he heard that amongſt thoſe Children under two years old,<note place="margin">Cum audiſſent inter eos quos in Syria Herodes Rex Judaeorum inter binatum juſſit interfici, filium quoque ejus occiſum, ait, Melius eſt Herodis porcum eſſe quam filium. Saturnal. lib. <hi>4.2.</hi>
               </note> whom <hi>Herod</hi> the King of the Jews had commanded to be killed in <hi>Syria,</hi> his own ſon was ſlain alſo, ſaid, <hi>It is better to be</hi> Herod <hi>'s hog than his ſon.</hi> In which ſpeech the Emperour had reference to the Jews abſtaining from ſwines fleſh, which to <hi>Herod</hi> would have been a great crime, though this murder ſeem none at all, if by that means his uſurped Dominion may be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſecured. So much for the firſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For the voice before a multitude which audibly declared him, we find three times to have been done. The firſt was at his Baptiſm, where before <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> and thoſe that came to be baptiſed of him, the heavens were opened, the Spirit of God deſcended like a Dove and light on him; and a voyce from Heaven ſaid, <hi>This is my beloved ſon in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> The ſecond was at his Transfiguration, where before three ſober men (a ſufficient number to aſſert any truth) <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> a voice out of the cloud gave teſtimony, that Jeſus was the Son of God, in whom he was well pleaſed; and that it was ſo we have St. <hi>Peter</hi> in his ſecond Epiſtle aſſuring us. The third was a little before his death; our Saviour praying that
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:58269:48"/>God would glorifie his Name; in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of a multitude a voyce came down from Heaven, ſaying, <hi>I have both glorified it, and will glorifie it.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Jo.</hi> 12.28.</note> Now though we cannot produce any authority from Heathens to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the truth of this voice, yet the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in the Story evince it to be true; for this was not done in a corner, <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> and his three Diſciples did not only hear it at two ſeveral times, but a multitude at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that in a publick place, when our Saviour rode in Triumph into <hi>Hieruſalem;</hi> and this multitude conſiſted partly of his Enemies the Jews; for we find for all this they believed him not; and partly of other Nations,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>ver.</hi> 34.</note> for there were then Greeks that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to ſee him.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>v.</hi> 20, 21.</note> So that had this been falſe, it had been obvious to the confutation of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry perſon, and the Phariſees would never have ſuffered ſo great a Miracle in the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of our Saviours Miſſion to have paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed uncontradicted, if ſo many witneſſes that aſſerted it had not put it beyond any denial. This voice now which we find atteſting our Saviour, doth alſo give witneſs to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, when on a ſudden there came a ſound from Heaven as of a ruſhing mighty wind, and filled all the houſe where they were ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it ſate upon each of them:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 2.13.</note> And they were all filled with the Holy Ghoſt, and began to ſpeak with their tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance.
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:58269:49"/>And this Miracle was ſo evident, that never any attempted to deny it: For beſides that it happened at ſo publick a time as <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> when the City was filled with people of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Nation to witneſs it; the nature of the Miracle it ſelf, the enabling of rude and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant men to ſpeak the Language of every Nation, carried along with it its own confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, had not the truth of it been evident to as many Nations as at that time reſorted to <hi>Hieruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this of all the Apoſtles let me adde the miraculous Call of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who by an audible voice from Heaven was turned from a Perſecuter to a Preacher of the Goſpel:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 8.4, 5, 6. <hi>Acts</hi> 16.12, 13, 14, 15, 16.</note> The whole ſtory we have recorded by Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> and aſſerted by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy for himſelf before King <hi>Agrippa.</hi> If we examine the Circumſtances of it, we ſhall find 'twas not done privately, but muſt neceſſarily be publickly known. The party converted was the greateſt Enemy the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel had; 'twas he that conſented to St. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi>'s death: The place of his converſion was when he came near <hi>Damaſcus</hi> with Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from the High Prieſts to bring all Chriſtians bound to <hi>Hieruſalem:</hi> The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his Converſion was, he fell to the earth, being ſo amazed with the light that ſhined about him, and more terrified with the voice that asked him, <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi> Adde to this, this was not done alone; for the men that were with
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:58269:49"/>him heard the voice, and not they only muſt be witneſſes of it, but he muſt be led blind to <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> that <hi>Ananias,</hi> who by his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers recovered him, and the whole City of <hi>Damaſcus</hi> that ſaw him, might know the truth of it. I might to theſe adde thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral fallings of the Holy Ghoſt upon Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, which 'tis probable fell by ſome way of viſible appearance, as that upon <hi>Cornelius</hi> by S. <hi>Peters</hi> preaching,<note place="margin">Acts 10.44. Acts 19.6.</note> upon the Chriſtians at <hi>Corinth</hi> by S. <hi>Paul;</hi> but I hope I need not urge them, having ſufficiently proved this Aſſertion from the Witneſs of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond Argument that aſſerts Chriſt to be this Law-giver, and confirms the Chriſtian Faith is, The miraculous pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in our Saviour of doing Miracles, and by him given to Chriſtians, together with the ſucceſs following, the deſtruction of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and ſudden Conqueſt of the World.</p>
            <p>For the better clearing this, 'tis neceſſary to take this Argument apieces, and to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle each branch apart. The whole is the Doctrine of Miracles, which I look upon as one of the moſt convincing Arguments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Atheiſme, or Heatheniſme, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Religion whatſoever; and this I ſhall do by proving,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The truth of ſeveral remarkable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions our Saviour foretold.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The wonderful Miracles which he did whileſt he lived, happened at his death, and were effected at his Reſurrection.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:58269:50"/> 3. The miraculous power that he gave the Apoſtles of doing Miracles, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the Church till the world became Chriſtian, and ſome time after.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The deſtruction of Idolatry, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the world to the name of a cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Saviour, by ſuch weak and ignorant perſons as the Apoſtles were. All which are reduced under the head of Miracles, ſome of each of which I ſhall prove from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Enemies of Chriſtianity, Jews or Heathens, which is the greateſt teſtimony matter of fact is capable of. I ſhall begin with the</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, The truth of ſeveral remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble praedictions our Saviour foretold. I will begin with that concerning his own ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: You ſhall find <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. after S. <hi>Peters</hi> confeſſion of our Saviours being the Meſſias, and our Saviours gracious promiſe to the Church, that the Gates of Hell ſhould not prevail over it, that he falls directly to tell them what muſt befall him, <hi>v.</hi> 21. <hi>From that time forth began Jeſus to ſhew unto his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples how that he muſt go into Hieruſalem and ſuffer many things of the Elders, and chief Prieſts, and Scribes, and be killed, and be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed again the third day.</hi> This prediction you ſee is a clear ſtory of his ſufferings as if they were paſt: 'Twas foretold long before his paſſion, and as it was the moſt unwelcome, ſo it was the moſt unexpected news that could have been told to his Diſciples, who 'tis clear
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:58269:50"/>expected a Temporal Prince: 'Twas ſuch news we ſee as put S. <hi>Peter</hi> into paſſion, that made that great Confeſſor ſo far to forget the duty of a Diſciple, as to rebuke his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. The truth of this matter of fact I ſhall prove when I treat of the Miracles our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our did. I might to this adde what our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour foretold to S. <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf concerning his denial of him, that though he was now ſo confident, <hi>that though all ſhould be offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet he never would be;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 26.34, 35, 36.</note>
               <hi>yet before the cock crew this night, he ſhould deny him thrice.</hi> Though this be but a particular paſſage, yet it deſerves our conſideration the more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this prediction was told to the perſon himſelf that might have prevented it, to one that had he not really been guilty of ſuch a fall as was foretold, would never have ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch a blemiſh to have been laid upon him without contradiction. To theſe I might joyn the ſeveral promiſes our Saviour made to his Church, which being to be given them after his Church, which being to be given them after his Aſcenſion, comes under the nature of predictions: As in particular that of the deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt which I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready handled,<note place="margin">John 14.26. Mar. 16.17.18.</note> and the power of doing Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, which I reſerve the proving of to its proper place. But that which here I ſhall moſt inſiſt upon, is that propheſie, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. which Chriſt foretells his Diſciples of the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of the Temple, even at that very time, when they ſo much admired the magnificent ſtructure of it: <hi>There ſhall not be left</hi> (ſaith
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:58269:51"/>he) <hi>one ſtone upon another that ſhall not be thrown down.</hi> And if we compare this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond verſe with the fifteenth; <hi>When ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall ſee the Abomination of Deſolation ſpoken of by</hi> Daniel <hi>the Prophet ſtand in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly place,</hi> &amp;c. by which words are meant the prophaning of their Temple by the Roman Eagle; we may probably gather being ſo to be prophaned that it was never to be built again; and this is clearly S. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>'s Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition:<note place="margin">

Here we have confeſſions of Chriſts miracles from two of the greateſt Enemies Chriſtianity ever had, <hi>Celſus</hi> and <hi>Julian:</hi> The firſt endeavoured by his pen, the laſt both by pen and power to deſtroy it; and yet the wonders our Saviour did were ſo evident above denial, that they were forced, though in a ſcoff, to acknowledge them. To theſe let us add the Epiſtle of <hi>Lentulus</hi> to the Emperour <hi>Tiberius,</hi> which <hi>Eutropius</hi> hath in his Annals of the Roman Senators, and is now commonly extant in the <hi>Bibliotheca Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum.</hi> He thus begins, There appeared in our days,<note place="margin">Apparuit temporibus noſtris, &amp; adbuc eſt, homo magnae virtutis, nominatus Jeſus Chriſtus, qui dicitur à Gentibus Propheta veritatis, quem ejus Diſcipuli vocant filium Dei, ſuſcitans mortuos, &amp; ſanans omnes lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guores.</note> and is yet, a man of great power named Chriſt

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:58269:54"/>accident that then happened, as we have recorded in the Evangeliſts, is impoſſible; but that moſt remarkable and wonderful defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sun at that time, was recorded by the Romans, and kept in their Archives till <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s time, as is evident from his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy.

Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member him alſo of another thing, which he is not ignorant of, to wit, that we noted that the cadence of the Moon began from the Eaſt, and went to the end of the Solar body, and then at laſt leapt back again.

Speak this, if it be lawful, [to <hi>Apollophanes.</hi>] From theſe Authorities we may eaſily gather the truth of this miraculous Eclipſe, which happening at full Moon, when in Nature it was impoſſible, will ſufficiently aſſure us, that the perſon then ſuffering was God, it being impoſſible for any but God to have done it: For thoſe Celeſtial Bodies as they are above all earthly pollutions, ſo they are infinitely beyond any Humane Command or Government.

            <p n="3">3. In the third place <hi>Tertullian</hi> begins his Book <hi>de Reſurrectione</hi> with this ezcellent Aphoriſme:<note place="margin">Fiducia Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianorum, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrectio Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuorum</note>
               <hi>The Faith of Chriſtians is the Reſurrection of the dead.</hi> Now as the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection is the comfort and great ſupport Chriſtians have againſt thoſe injuries and ſufferings which in this world they are expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to; So the Reſurrection of our Saviour, <hi>Who was the Firſt-fruits of them that ſleep,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.20.</note> was the great aſſurance that thoſe that dye in his fear ſhall be raiſed by his power, and live with him in glory. This then is the Foundation of our Faith, the Reſurrection; the aſſurance that we ſhall be raiſed is, That Chriſt is riſen. And this I ſhall prove. I
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:58269:55"/>muſt not here omit thoſe ſeveral witneſſes to this grand Truth which S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 15. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. cites. If when we prove matter of Fact, the number of Teſtimonies be weight, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour was not only ſeen, when riſen, by <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas,</hi> and the 12 Apoſtles, but by 500 at once, which certainly were too great a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber either to be deceived or deceive.<note place="margin">

This together with the conſtant belief ſucceeding Ages gave to it might perſwade any not wilfully obſtinate, to admit it without diſpute: But becauſe <hi>Atheiſme</hi> now prevails with moſt, and that in this Age Principles ſcarce paſs without queſtioning, I ſhall produce what other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities my reading affordeth to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſhall be my firſt Authour, who in his fourth Chapter and eighteenth Book hath theſe words.<note place="margin">Eodem tempore fuit Jeſus vir ſapiens, ſi tamen virum eum fas eſt dicere; Erat enim mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabilium operum patrator, &amp; doctor eorum qui libenter ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra ſuſcipiunt, plurimoſque tam de Judaeis quàm de Gentibus ſectatores habuit: Christus hic erat quem accuſatum à noſtris gentis Principibus, Pilatus cum addixiſſet Cruci, nihil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ominus non deſtiterunt cum di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligere qui ab initio caeperant.

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:58269:56"/>of thoſe who at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning did ſo. He appeared to them the third day alive, the holy Prophets foretelling theſe and many wonderful things of him; and until this day the Chriſtian Sect is not failed, who from him had their denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. This Teſtimony of <hi>Joſephus</hi> a Jew is very clear, as to the particular to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; there remains only here to be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, whether theſe words be <hi>Joſephus</hi> his, and that they are ſo, appears from theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: Firſt, becauſe this very Teſtimony for Chriſts Miracles is urged by <hi>Euſebius</hi> in his firſt Book of his Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, <hi>cap.</hi> 11. in theſe words, and for this purpoſe. <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hius,</hi> we know, lived at the beginning of the fourth Century, in the days of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Emperour, and at that time this trick of forging books was ſcarce invented; neither was it neceſſary to forge an Authority to prove the truth of Chriſts Miracles then, when the power of doing Miracles ſtill remained in the Church, and was a ſufficient Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that he that could give that miraculous power to others wanted it not himſelf. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, becauſe the ſuſpition of this place proceedeth from a falſe ſuppoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is not found in the Ancient Copy in the <hi>Vatican</hi> Library, which indeed is true, 'tis not found in that Ancient Copy, but there is a blank where formerly it was written, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſt of capacity to contain theſe words;
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:58269:56"/>which evidently aſſures us, that by the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence or wickedneſs of ſome Jew or Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick theſe words were eraſed; and this being true, I ſuppoſe there is none but will credit this Authority the more for this raſement, ſince nothing but the conſciouſneſs of this Impoſtor of the truth of theſe words, could ever have made him guilty of ſo great a Treachery. Now in confirmation of this we have the Authority of <hi>Baronius</hi> a learned Cardinal, who himſelf was Library-keeper to the Apoſtolique See, and an eye witneſs of this Truth.

But the malice of the Jews did burn to ſo great a height, that they gave mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to his Keepers, and bid them ſay that his Diſciples had taken him away.

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:58269:60"/>the way how he did them. <hi>Arnobius</hi> ſhall conclude this Subject for me.

We neither urge nor ſeek what they promiſe to do, or in what kind of Acts all their Learning and Experience uſed to be contained. And a little after he concludes. But it is evident that Chriſt did all theſe things without any help of outward things,<note place="margin">Atqui constitit Christum ſine ullis adminiculis Rerum, ſine ullius Ratus obſervatione, vel lege, omnia illa nominis ſui poſſibilitate feciſſe. <hi>Ibid.</hi>

And his firſt teſtimony is not a bare aſſertion, but a challenge which he ſends the Roman Senators, in that moſt excellent Apology of his, to try the truth of this miraculous power in the Church. His words are theſe, Let any one be brought before your Tribunals who is apparently poſſeſſed with a Devil;<note place="margin">Edatur hic aliquis ſub Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalibus veſtris quem Daemone agi conſtet, juſſus a quolibet quolibet Chriſtiano loqui Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus ille, tam ſe Daemonem confitebitur de vero, quam ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi Deum de falſo.

            <p>I ſhould ſay no more out of this Father did not the Elegancy of the words, and the Excellency of the ſenſe perſwade me to what is already ſaid, to adde this excellent advice which he gives Chriſtians under perſecution, not to flye, but to ſtand to it: Mark his words.

               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:58269:68"/>who had not either ſeen or learnt this, neither is any that could upon any reaſon forget it. There were ten children, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſeven were men, and three women, of <hi>Caeſaraea</hi> in <hi>Cappa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docia,</hi> amongſt their Citizens not ignoble, who by the curſe of their mother (newly depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the death of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who bitterly took ſome injury done her by them) were inflicted from God with ſuch a puniſhment, that they did moſt dreadfully ſhake with the trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of their joynts, in which moſt ſad condition, no ways being able to endure the being ſeen by their Citizens, it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed good unto them to go every where about; and they did wander almoſt throughout all the Roman world. Of theſe, two of them came to us, a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and a Siſter, <hi>Paulus</hi> and <hi>Palladia,</hi> known in many places by this defaming miſery. They came thither almoſt fifteen days before Eaſter, and praying they every day frequented the Church, and in it the Shrine of the moſt glorious <hi>Stephen,</hi> that God would be appeaſed
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:58269:69"/>with them, and reſtore them their former health; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they went they drew up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them the eyes of the whole City; ſome becauſe they had ſeen them in other places, and knew the cauſe of that trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, others that they might tell it to as many as they could. <hi>Eaſter</hi> comes, and in the Lords day in the morning, when even now there was a great multitude of people preſent, and this youth praying and holding faſt the Rails of that holy place where the Shrine was, fell ſuddenly down, and lay as one ſleeping, yet not trembling as be was wont when he ſlept. Thoſe that were preſent being amazed, and ſome being afraid, others grieving; when therefore ſome would have raiſed him up, they hindred ſaying, the event was to be expected: And he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf roſe up and did not trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, becauſe he was healed; He ſtood up whole looking on thoſe that looked on him. Who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the beholders could hold himſelf from praiſing God? The Church every where was filled with the acclamations of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:58269:69"/>ſhouters, and givers of God thanks. From thence they ran to me where I ſate, being now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to go on proceſſion: One af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another they ruſh upon me, the laſt relating to me that as new, what another had before told me. When I was rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, and by my ſelf giving God thanks, he himſelf comes in to me, with many more, he falls down at my knees, ſtands up to my kiſs: We go forth to the people, the Church was full and did eccho with the voice of Rejoycings, and every where crying, Thanks be to God, Praiſe be to God, none holding their peace. I ſaluted the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and again they ecchoed the ſame things with a more ſervent voice: Silence at length being made, the accuſtomed Leſſons of the Holy Scripture were read: When therefore it was come to the place of my Sermon, I ſpake a few words for the time, and for the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs of this joy; for I thought fit they ſhould rather conſider a kind of divine elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence in the holy work, then hear it. The man dined with
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:58269:70"/>us, and exactly ſhewed us all the Story both of his Mothers and Brothers Calamity. The fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing day, after the Sermon was done, I promiſed on the morrow that a Book of this Story ſhould be read to the people: When this thing was done in the third Lords day of Eaſter week, upon the ſteps of the Chore, in which I ſpake from a higher place; I made both theſe brothers to ſtand whilſt their Book was read. The whole people of both ſexes did ſee one ſtanding without any deformed motion, the other trembling in all her joynts; and they which did not ſee what of Gods mercy was done in him, might perceive it in his Siſter: They ſaw in him what was to be thanked for; what for her was to be pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for. Amongſt theſe things when their book was read, I commanded them to go out of the ſight of the people, and began of the whole cauſe to diſpute a little more diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; when behold whilſt I was diſputing, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thee new voyces of rejoycing were heard from the Memorial of the Martyr. They turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about thither who heard me, and began run: For after ſhe had gone down the ſteps where ſhee ſtood, ſhee went forwards to
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:58269:70"/>pray at the holy Martyrs Shrine; who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently as ſhe had touched the Rails, falling down in like manner, as aſleep, roſe up re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. When therefore we did require what was done, from whence that joyful noiſe came, they entred with her into the Chore where we were, bringing her whole from the place of the Martyrs Shrine. Then there began ſo great a noiſe of admiration from both ſexes, that the voice being conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued with the former weeping for her, did ſeem not to have ended: She is brought to that place where a little before ſhe ſtood trembling: They rejoyced to ſee her made like her brother, whom before they pityed to have remained ſo unlike; and they ſaw, though the prayers for her were not yet put up, yet that their praevious deſire was ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly heard. They did lift up to the praiſe of God their voices without words with ſo great a ſound as our ears could ſcarcely bear it: For what was in their hearts but the Faith of Chriſt, for which <hi>Stephen</hi>'s blood was ſhed? Thus he. And though this Story be long, yet not unworthy either of our reading or conſidering.</p>

               <hi>Plutarch</hi> hath written a whole Book of the cauſe why the Oracles ceaſed; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is conducing to the Subject I have in hand, I ſhall give you contracted the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the whole Book. The ſum of this whole Book ſeems to be a conference between <hi>Demetrius</hi> and <hi>Cleombrotus,</hi> which they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in when they were at the Temple of <hi>Apollo</hi> at <hi>Delphos:</hi> For one of them having rehearſed a wonder of the Temple of <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Hammon,</hi> moved thereby a further deſire of Diſputation; and after ſome by-diſcourſe they came to the main point, namely, why all the Oracles of <hi>Greece</hi> (excepting that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of <hi>Lebadia</hi>) ceaſed. To which demand <hi>Planetiades</hi> another Philoſopher there an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered; That the wickedneſs of men was the cauſe of it: <hi>Ammonius</hi> another Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher attributeth all unto the Wars which had conſumed the Pilgrims that had uſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort thither. <hi>Lamprias</hi> propoſeth one opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and <hi>Cleombrotus</hi> inferring another, they fall into a Diſcourſe touching Daemons, whom he verily ranketh between God and men, diſputing of their nature according to the Greek Philoſophy; Then he proveth that theſe Daemons have the charge of Oracles, but by reaſon they departed out of one Country into another, or dyed, they ceaſed. And to this purpoſe he telleth us a notable ſtory of the death of great <hi>Pan. Ammonius</hi> confutes the Epicureans that ſay there are no
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:58269:76"/>Daemons. <hi>Demetrius</hi> demands why they have this power to govern Oracles, and they all agree with the Platonick Philoſophy of the principal, efficient, and final cauſe of thoſe things that are effected by reaſon, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly of Divination and Praediction. In fine, <hi>Plutarch</hi> attributeth all to Exhalations from the Earth, which breathing out hath touched the underſtanding of men with ſuch efficacy as to cauſe them to foreſee future things: That as ſome grounds are more fertile, ſo ſome places of the Earth do naturally ingender and incite Enthuſiaſtick and divining Spirits; and that this power is divine, but not eternal or perdurable, but by proceſs and ſucceſſion of time doth diminiſh and decay; and that this great number of Spirits are not at once ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, neither proceed they forward or retire backward continually; but that this vertue of the Earth moveth by certain Revolutions, and by that means is puffed up, and after that in time it hath gathered new vapours it filleth the caves and holes ſo full, until they diſcharge themſelves, and ſend them up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: Whereupon it cometh to paſs, that the Exhalations ſtirred in the ſaid Caves, and deſirous to iſſue forth, after that they have been beaten back again, violently aſſail the Foundations, and ſtirre the Temples built upon them, in ſuch ſort as if being ſhaken by Earth-quakes, more or leſs to one place then another, according to the avertures and paſſages made for the Exhalation, they find
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:58269:77"/>iſſue through the ſtreights, break forth with forcible violence, and ſo produce theſe Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. This is the Contents of this Diſcourſe; and I judged it moſt convenient to give you the Heads of it all, that as you may ſee on one hand we have him confeſſing, That all the Oracles of <hi>Greece</hi> (excepting that of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badia</hi>) were ceaſed; ſo on the other hand we may ſee how empty the reaſons of this great Philoſopher are for their ceaſing, and making theſe gods mortal, who were thoſe they worſhipped, how contemptible their whole Religion was. But becauſe the ſtory of this death of <hi>Pan</hi> here related, carries in it ſelf a particular relation of the deſtruction of their greateſt Deity, I ſhall here repeat it out of the Authour.

He ſaith, that intending to ſail into <hi>Italy,</hi> and to that purpoſe aſcending into a Ship that carried in it much Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize and many paſſengers; that about evening when they were near the Iſlands <hi>Echina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> the wind went down, and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:58269:77"/>the Ship was carried near about the Iſland <hi>Paxos,</hi> and there they heard one calling aloud <hi>Thamous,</hi> that all admired. Now this <hi>Thamous</hi> was an Aegyptian Ship-maſter, and not known by name to many of thoſe that ſailed with him. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing twice called he held his peace, but the third time an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Caller, who then ſpake theſe continued words. When thou comeſt over againſt the <hi>Palodes,</hi> declare that the great god <hi>Pan</hi> is dead. Thoſe things being heard, <hi>Epitherſis</hi> reports, that they were afraid, and did reaſon amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves whether they had better obey this command, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any curioſity do otherwiſe; but that <hi>Thamous</hi> did deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, that if there was wind if there was a great calm about that place, that then he would publiſh what he heard. When therefore they came over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Palodes,</hi> and there being no wind, nor wave, <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous</hi> in the Prow of the Ship ſpake towards the Land what he had heard, that the great god <hi>Pan</hi> was
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:58269:78"/>dead: Which when he had done, he further reports, that there was a great groaning mixed with admiration. Which things, there being many preſent, did ſuddenly ſpread at <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Thamous</hi> was ſent for by <hi>Tyberius Caeſar</hi> who believed this relation, and made diligent enquiry after what this <hi>Pan</hi> was. And ſo he goes on to produce more witneſſes of this matter of fact, which indeed is in it ſelf ſtrange, and affords us to what I have formerly ſaid, the Devils Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, that he was overcome, and that all Idolatry muſt be deſtroyed. But if to this we adde, That this happened, as <hi>Baronius</hi> tells me,<note place="margin">Ad annum 34 Chriſti, p. 181.</note> in the eighteenth year of <hi>Tyberius Caeſar,</hi> which was the very year our Saviour ſuffered, which we may find preſſed by <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius</hi> in his ninth Chapter of his fifth Book <hi>de Praeparatione Evangelica,</hi> we have great reaſon to ſuppoſe this happened juſt at the time of our Saviours Crucifixion, who as in his life he caſt them out, and made them tremble, ſo at his death he overcame and vanquiſhed them.</p>

            <p>To reckon up their ſeveral miraculous ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, were to repeat their ancient Martyro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies, and to ſtretch the bounds of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to an endleſs length: I ſhall therefore only inſiſt upon one particular, wherein the Chriſtians in their ſufferings have exceeded all other ſufferers; that is, in their offering themſelves to ſuffer. We ſhall find many examples of men who were ſo obſtinate to their opinions, that they have choſen death
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:58269:87"/>rather than a recantation of their errours; but yet I never heard of any that went ſo far, as in defence of an errour to offer himſelf to ſuffer; and this the Chriſtians did, if we will believe <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate, who in his fragments tells us of the Chriſtians, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theſe Atheiſts out of zeal do perſwade,<note place="margin">
